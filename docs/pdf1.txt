About Principles of Macroeconomics 3e

Principles of Macroeconomics 3ealigns to the topics and objectives of most introductory microeconomics

courses. The text uses conversational language and ample illustrations to explore economic theories, and

provides a wide array of examples using both fictional and real-world scenarios. The third edition has been

carefully and thoroughly updated to reflect current data and understanding, as well as to provide a deeper

background in diverse contributors and their impacts on economic thought and analysis.

2 Preface

Coverage and scope

In response to faculty feedback and to ease transition to a new edition, Principles of Macroeconomics 3e

retains the organization of the previous editions. The book covers the breadth of economics topics and also

provides the necessary depth to ensure the course is manageable for instructors and students alike. We strove

to balance theory and application, as well as the amount of calculation and mathematical examples.

The book is organized into seven main parts:

• What is Economics? The first two chapters introduce students to the study of economics with a focus on

making choices in a world of scarce resources.

• Supply and Demand, Chapters 3 and 4, introduces and explains the first analytical model in economics:

supply, demand, and equilibrium, before showing applications in the markets for labor and finance.

• Elasticity and Price, Chapter 5, introduces and explains elasticity and price, two key concepts in

economics.

• The Macroeconomic Perspective and Goals, Chapters 6 through 10, introduces a number of key concepts

in macro: economic growth, unemployment and inflation, and international trade and capital flows.

• A Framework for Macroeconomic Analysis, Chapters 11 through 13, introduces the principal analytic

model in macro, namely the aggregate demand/aggregate supply Model. The model is then applied to the

Keynesian and Neoclassical perspectives. The expenditure-output model is fully explained in a stand-

alone appendix.

• Monetary and Fiscal Policy, Chapters 14 through 18, explains the role of money and the banking system,

as well as monetary policy and financial regulation. Then the discussion switches to government deficits

and fiscal policy.

•

International Economics, Chapters 19 through 21, the final part of the text, introduces the international

dimensions of economics, including international trade and protectionism.

Changes to the third edition

The revision process incorporated extensive feedback from faculty who have used the book in their courses.

They advised that the third edition changes focus on currency updates, integration of newer perspectives and

more diverse contributors, and relevance to students’ lives and careers.

Current data and analysis: The authors have updated dozens of explanations, graphs, and tables containing

financial, demographic, employment, and related economic data. The corresponding discussions provide

context and interpretations of the data, including descriptions of change over time, cause-and-effect

relationships, and balanced analysis of policies and opinions.

Diverse perspectives and contributors: The third edition highlights the research and views of a broader
group of economists. These include people from across the spectrum of economic thought, with a particular

focus on those who take what are often considered non-traditional views of economic policy and government

action. Examples include:

• Chapter 1: Esther Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee, and Michael Kremer regarding experimental analysis in

development economics.

• Chapter 4: Walter Williams and Thomas Sowell regarding the downsides of minimum wages.

• Chapter 6: Kate Raworth, regarding concepts for expanding economic measures beyond GDP and similar

metrics.

• Chapter 19: W. Arthur Lewis and the dual sector economy; Dambisa Moyo regarding the benefits and

detriments of foreign aid.

Relevance and engagement: In order to show the importance and application of economics in students’ lives

and careers, the third edition directly addresses and expands topics likely to connect to various industries,

issues, groups, and events. Brief references and deeply explored socio-political examples have been updated

Preface 3

to showcase the critical—and sometimes unnoticed—ties between economic developments and topics relevant

to students. Examples include education spending, the value of college degrees, discrimination, environmental

policies, immigration policies, entrepreneurship and innovation, healthcare and insurance, and general

financial literacy. Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic is referenced frequently to demonstrate its deep and

evolving impacts on financial data, employment, and other aspects of the economy.

FRED Data and Graphs: As in previous editions, the authors have included and referenced data from the

Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). In some cases, interactive FRED graphs are embedded directly in the

web view of the book; students may magnify and focus on specific time periods, analyze individual data points,

and otherwise manipulate the graphs from within the OpenStax reading experience. In others cases (and in

the PDF), links to the direct source of the FRED data are provided, and students are encouraged to explore the

information and the overall FRED resources more thoroughly. Note that other data sources, such as the Bureau

of Labor Statistics, U.S. Census Bureau, and World Bank, usually include links in the captions or credits;

instructors and students can also explore those sites for more detailed investigations of the topics at hand.

Updated art

Principles of Macroeconomics 3eincludes updated and redesigned art to clarify concepts and provide

opportunities for graphical interpretation. Many graphs are shown with accompanying data tables and

explanations of the drivers and consequences of change.

4 Preface

Pedagogical foundation

The narrative explanations and analysis presented in Principles of Macroeconomics 3ehave been carefully

crafted to provide a solid basis in economic concepts, flexibly approach skills and assess understanding, and

deepen students’ engagement with the course materials. You will also find features that promote economic

inquiry and explorations, including:

• Bring It Home: These explorations include a brief case study, specific to each chapter, which connects the

chapter’s main topic to the real word. It is broken up into two parts: the first at the beginning of the

chapter (in the intro module) and the second at chapter’s end, when students have learned what’s

necessary to understand the case and “bring home” the chapter’s core concepts.

• Work It Out: These worked examples progress through an analytical or computational problem, and guide

students step by step to find out how its solution is derived.

• Clear It Up: These boxes are deeper explanations of something in the main body of the text. Each CIU

starts with a question. The rest of the feature explains the answer.

Questions for each level of learning

Principles of Macroeconomics 3eoffers flexibility in practice and assessment, and provides a range of

opportunities to check understanding and encourage deeper thinking and application.

• Self-Checks are analytical self-assessment questions that appear at the end of each module. They “click to

reveal” an answer in the web view so students can check their understanding before moving on to the next

module. Self-Check questions are not simple look-up questions. They push the student to think beyond

what is said in the text. Self-Check questions are designed for formative (rather than summative)

Preface 5

assessment. The questions and answers are explained so that students feel like they are being walked

through the problem.

• Review Questions have been retained from Taylor’s version, and are simple recall questions from the

chapter in open-response format (not multiple choice or true/false). The answers can be looked up in the

text.

• Critical Thinking Questions are new higher-level, conceptual questions that ask students to demonstrate

their understanding by applying what they have learned in different contexts.

• Problems are exercises that give students additional practice working with the analytic and

computational concepts in the module.

society. Today, social media giants Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are major forces on the information super

highway. (Credit: modification of "Social Media Mixed Icons - Banner" by Blogtrepreneur/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES

In this chapter, you will learn about:

• What Is Economics, and Why Is It Important?

• Microeconomics and Macroeconomics

• How Economists Use Theories and Models to Understand Economic Issues

• How Economies Can Be Organized: An Overview of Economic Systems

Introduction

BRING IT HOME

Information Overload in the Information Age
To post or not to post? Every day we are faced with a myriad of decisions, from what to have for breakfast, to which

show to stream, to the more complex—“Should I double major and add possibly another semester of study to my

education?” Our response to these choices depends on the information we have available at any given moment.

Economists call this “imperfect” because we rarely have all the data we need to make perfect decisions. Despite the

lack of perfect information, we still make hundreds of decisions a day.

Streams, sponsors, and social media are altering the process by which we make choices, how we spend our time,

which movies we see, which products we buy, and more. Whether they read the reviews or just check the ratings, it's

unlikely for Americans to make many significant decisions without these information streams.

As you will see in this course, what happens in economics is affected by how well and how fast information

disseminates through a society, such as how quickly information travels through Facebook. “Economists love

nothing better than when deep and liquid markets operate under conditions of perfect information,” says Jessica

Irvine, National Economics Editor for News Corp Australia.

This leads us to the topic of this chapter, an introduction to the world of making decisions, processing information,

10 1 • Welcome to Economics!

and understanding behavior in markets —the world of economics. Each chapter in this book will start with a

discussion about current (or sometimes past) events and revisit it at chapter’s end—to “bring home” the concepts in

play.

What is economics and why should you spend your time learning it? After all, there are other disciplines you

could be studying, and other ways you could be spending your time. As the Bring it Home feature just

mentioned, making choices is at the heart of what economists study, and your decision to take this course is as

much as economic decision as anything else.

Economics is probably not what you think. It is not primarily about money or finance. It is not primarily about

business. It is not mathematics. What is it then? It is both a subject area and a way of viewing the world.

1.1 What Is Economics, and Why Is It Important?

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Discuss the importance of studying economics

• Explain the relationship between production and division of labor

• Evaluate the significance of scarcity

Economics is the study of how humans make decisions in the face of scarcity. These can be individual

decisions, family decisions, business decisions or societal decisions. If you look around carefully, you will see

that scarcity is a fact of life. Scarcity means that human wants for goods, services and resources exceed what

is available. Resources, such as labor, tools, land, and raw materials are necessary to produce the goods and

services we want but they exist in limited supply. Of course, the ultimate scarce resource is time- everyone,

rich or poor, has just 24 expendable hours in the day to earn income to acquire goods and services, for leisure

time, or for sleep. At any point in time, there is only a finite amount of resources available.

Think about it this way: In 2015 the labor force in the United States contained over 158 million workers,

according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The total land area was 3,794,101 square miles. While these

are certainly large numbers, they are not infinite. Because these resources are limited, so are the numbers of

goods and services we produce with them. Combine this with the fact that human wants seem to be virtually

infinite, and you can see why scarcity is a problem.

Introduction to FRED

Data is very important in economics because it describes and measures the issues and problems that

economics seek to understand. A variety of government agencies publish economic and social data. For this
course, we will generally use data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank's FRED database. FRED is very user

friendly. It allows you to display data in tables or charts, and you can easily download it into spreadsheet form

if you want to use the data for other purposes. The FRED website (https://openstax.org/l/FRED/) includes data

on nearly 400,000 domestic and international variables over time, in the following broad categories:

• Money, Banking & Finance

• Population, Employment, & Labor Markets (including Income Distribution)

• National Accounts (Gross Domestic Product & its components), Flow of Funds, and International Accounts

• Production & Business Activity (including Business Cycles)

• Prices & Inflation (including the Consumer Price Index, the Producer Price Index, and the Employment

Cost Index)

•

International Data from other nations

• U.S. Regional Data

• Academic Data (including Penn World Tables & NBER Macrohistory database)

resources is real. (Credit: "Pittsburgh Homeless" by "daveyinn"/Flickr Creative Commons, CC BY 2.0)

If you still do not believe that scarcity is a problem, consider the following: Does everyone require food to eat?

Does everyone need a decent place to live? Does everyone have access to healthcare? In every country in the

world, there are people who are hungry, homeless (for example, those who call park benches their beds, as

Figure 1.2 shows), and in need of healthcare, just to focus on a few critical goods and services. Why is this the

case? It is because of scarcity. Let’s delve into the concept of scarcity a little deeper, because it is crucial to

understanding economics.

The Problem of Scarcity

Think about all the things you consume: food, shelter, clothing, transportation, healthcare, and entertainment.

How do you acquire those items? You do not produce them yourself. You buy them. How do you afford the

things you buy? You work for pay. If you do not, someone else does on your behalf. Yet most of us never have

enough income to buy all the things we want. This is because of scarcity. So how do we solve it?

LINK IT UP

Visit this website (http://openstax.org/l/drought) to read about how the United States is dealing with scarcity in

resources.

Every society, at every level, must make choices about how to use its resources. Families must decide whether

to spend their money on a new car or a fancy vacation. Towns must choose whether to put more of the budget

into police and fire protection or into the school system. Nations must decide whether to devote more funds to

national defense or to protecting the environment. In most cases, there just isn’t enough money in the budget

to do everything. How do we use our limited resources the best way possible, that is, to obtain the most goods

and services we can? There are a couple of options. First, we could each produce everything we each consume.

Alternatively, we could each produce some of what we want to consume, and “trade” for the rest of what we

want. Let’s explore these options. Why do we not each just produce all of the things we consume? Think back to

pioneer days, when individuals knew how to do so much more than we do today, from building their homes, to

growing their crops, to hunting for food, to repairing their equipment. Most of us do not know how to do all—or

any—of those things, but it is not because we could not learn. Rather, we do not have to. The reason why is

something called the division and specialization of labor, a production innovation first put forth by Adam

Smith (Figure 1.3) in his book, The Wealth of Nations.

12 1 • Welcome to Economics!

FIGURE 1.3 Adam Smith Adam Smith introduced the idea of dividing labor into discrete tasks. (Credit: "Adam

Smith" by Cadell and Davies (1811), John Horsburgh (1828), or R.C. Bell (1872)/Wikimedia Commons, Public

Domain)

The Division of and Specialization of Labor

The formal study of economics began when Adam Smith (1723–1790) published his famous book The Wealth

of Nationsin 1776. Many authors had written on economics in the centuries before Smith, but he was the first

to address the subject in a comprehensive way. In the first chapter, Smith introduces the concept of division of

labor, which means that the way one produces a good or service is divided into a number of tasks that

different workers perform, instead of all the tasks being done by the same person.

To illustrate division of labor, Smith counted how many tasks went into making a pin: drawing out a piece of

wire, cutting it to the right length, straightening it, putting a head on one end and a point on the other, and

packaging pins for sale, to name just a few. Smith counted 18 distinct tasks that different people

performed—all for a pin, believe it or not!

Modern businesses divide tasks as well. Even a relatively simple business like a restaurant divides the task of

serving meals into a range of jobs like top chef, sous chefs, less-skilled kitchen help, servers to wait on the

tables, a greeter at the door, janitors to clean up, and a business manager to handle paychecks and bills—not to

mention the economic connections a restaurant has with suppliers of food, furniture, kitchen equipment, and

the building where it is located. A complex business like a large manufacturing factory, such as the shoe

factory (Figure 1.4), or a hospital can have hundreds of job classifications.

1.1 • What Is Economics, and Why Is It Important? 13

Why the Division of Labor Increases Production

When we divide and subdivide the tasks involved with producing a good or service, workers and businesses

can produce a greater quantity of output. In his observations of pin factories, Smith noticed that one worker

alone might make 20 pins in a day, but that a small business of 10 workers (some of whom would need to

complete two or three of the 18 tasks involved with pin-making), could make 48,000 pins in a day. How can a

group of workers, each specializing in certain tasks, produce so much more than the same number of workers

who try to produce the entire good or service by themselves? Smith offered three reasons.

First, specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process

where they have an advantage. (In later chapters, we will develop this idea by discussing comparative

advantage.) People have different skills, talents, and interests, so they will be better at some jobs than at others.

The particular advantages may be based on educational choices, which are in turn shaped by interests and

talents. Only those with medical degrees qualify to become doctors, for instance. For some goods, geography

affects specialization. For example, it is easier to be a wheat farmer in North Dakota than in Florida, but easier

to run a tourist hotel in Florida than in North Dakota. If you live in or near a big city, it is easier to attract

enough customers to operate a successful dry cleaning business or movie theater than if you live in a sparsely
populated rural area. Whatever the reason, if people specialize in the production of what they do best, they will
be more effective than if they produce a combination of things, some of which they are good at and some of

which they are not.

Second, workers who specialize in certain tasks often learn to produce more quickly and with higher quality.

This pattern holds true for many workers, including assembly line laborers who build cars, stylists who cut

hair, and doctors who perform heart surgery. In fact, specialized workers often know their jobs well enough to

suggest innovative ways to do their work faster and better.

A similar pattern often operates within businesses. In many cases, a business that focuses on one or a few

products (sometimes called its “core competency”) is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range

of products.

Third, specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale, which means that for many

goods, as the level of production increases, the average cost of producing each individual unit declines. For

example, if a factory produces only 100 cars per year, each car will be quite expensive to make on average.

However, if a factory produces 50,000 cars each year, then it can set up an assembly line with huge machines

and workers performing specialized tasks, and the average cost of production per car will be lower. The

ultimate result of workers who can focus on their preferences and talents, learn to do their specialized jobs

better, and work in larger organizations is that society as a whole can produce and consume far more than if

each person tried to produce all of their own goods and services. The division and specialization of labor has
been a force against the problem of scarcity.

Trade and Markets

Specialization only makes sense, though, if workers can use the pay they receive for doing their jobs to

purchase the other goods and services that they need. In short, specialization requires trade.

You do not have to know anything about electronics or sound systems to play music—you just buy an iPod or

MP3 player, download the music, and listen. You do not have to know anything about artificial fibers or the

construction of sewing machines if you need a jacket—you just buy the jacket and wear it. You do not need to

know anything about internal combustion engines to operate a car—you just get in and drive. Instead of trying

to acquire all the knowledge and skills involved in producing all of the goods and services that you wish to

consume, the market allows you to learn a specialized set of skills and then use the pay you receive to buy the

goods and services you need or want. This is how our modern society has evolved into a strong economy.

Why Study Economics?

FIGURE 1.5 Esther Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee, and Michael Kremer Esther Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee (both from

Massachusetts Institute of Technology), and Michael Kremer (University of Chicago) were awarded the Nobel Prize

for groundbreaking work in which they established experimental methods to understand poverty and outcomes of

initiatives to address it. (Credit: modification of work by U.S. Embassy Sweden/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.0;

Now that you have an overview on what economics studies, let’s quickly discuss why you are right to study it.

Economics is not primarily a collection of facts to memorize, although there are plenty of important concepts

to learn. Instead, think of economics as a collection of questions to answer or puzzles to work. Most

importantly, economics provides the tools to solve those puzzles.

Consider the complex and critical issue of education barriers on national and regional levels, which affect

millions of people and result in widespread poverty and inequality. Governments, aid organizations, and

wealthy individuals spend billions of dollars each year trying to address these issues. Nations announce the

revitalization of their education programs; tech companies donate devices and infrastructure, and celebrities

and charities build schools and sponsor students. Yet the problems remain, sometimes almost as pronounced

as they were before the intervention. Why is that the case? In 2019, three economists—Esther Duflo, Abhijit

Banerjee, and Michael Kremer—were awarded the Nobel Prize for their work to answer those questions. They

worked diligently to break the widespread problems into smaller pieces, and experimented with small

interventions to test success. The award citation credited their work with giving the world better tools and

information to address poverty and improve education. Esther Duflo, who is the youngest person and second

woman to win the Nobel Prize in Economics, said, "We believed that like the war on cancer, the war on poverty

was not going to be won in one major battle, but in a series of small triumphs. . . . This work and the culture of

learning that it fostered in governments has led to real improvement in the lives of hundreds of millions of

poor people.”

As you can see, economics affects far more than business. For example:

• Virtually every major problem facing the world today, from global warming, to world poverty, to the

conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia, has an economic dimension. If you are going to be part of

solving those problems, you need to be able to understand them. Economics is crucial.

•

It is hard to overstate the importance of economics to good citizenship. You need to be able to vote

intelligently on budgets, regulations, and laws in general. When the U.S. government came close to a

standstill at the end of 2012 due to the “fiscal cliff,” what were the issues? Did you know?

• A basic understanding of economics makes you a well-rounded thinker. When you read articles about

economic issues, you will understand and be able to evaluate the writer’s argument. When you hear

1.2 • Microeconomics and Macroeconomics 15

classmates, co-workers, or political candidates talking about economics, you will be able to distinguish

between common sense and nonsense. You will find new ways of thinking about current events and about

personal and business decisions, as well as current events and politics.

The study of economics does not dictate the answers, but it can illuminate the different choices.

1.2 Microeconomics and Macroeconomics

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Describe microeconomics

• Describe macroeconomics

• Contrast monetary policy and fiscal policy

Economics is concerned with the well-being of allpeople, including those with jobs and those without jobs, as

well as those with high incomes and those with low incomes. Economics acknowledges that production of

useful goods and services can create problems of environmental pollution. It explores the question of how

investing in education helps to develop workers’ skills. It probes questions like how to tell when big businesses

or big labor unions are operating in a way that benefits society as a whole and when they are operating in a way
that benefits their owners or members at the expense of others. It looks at how government spending, taxes,

and regulations affect decisions about production and consumption.

It should be clear by now that economics covers considerable ground. We can divide that ground into two

parts: Microeconomics focuses on the actions of individual agents within the economy, like households,

workers, and businesses. Macroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as

growth of production, the number of unemployed people, the inflationary increase in prices, government

deficits, and levels of exports and imports. Microeconomics and macroeconomics are not separate subjects,

but rather complementary perspectives on the overall subject of the economy.

To understand why both microeconomic and macroeconomic perspectives are useful, consider the problem of

studying a biological ecosystem like a lake. One person who sets out to study the lake might focus on specific

topics: certain kinds of algae or plant life; the characteristics of particular fish or snails; or the trees

surrounding the lake. Another person might take an overall view and instead consider the lake's ecosystem

from top to bottom; what eats what, how the system stays in a rough balance, and what environmental stresses

affect this balance. Both approaches are useful, and both examine the same lake, but the viewpoints are

different. In a similar way, both microeconomics and macroeconomics study the same economy, but each has

a different viewpoint.

Whether you are scrutinizing lakes or economics, the micro and the macro insights should blend with each
other. In studying a lake, the micro insights about particular plants and animals help to understand the overall

food chain, while the macro insights about the overall food chain help to explain the environment in which

individual plants and animals live.

In economics, the micro decisions of individual businesses are influenced by whether the macroeconomy is

healthy. For example, firms will be more likely to hire workers if the overall economy is growing. In turn,

macroeconomy's performance ultimately depends on the microeconomic decisions that individual

households and businesses make.

Microeconomics

What determines how households and individuals spend their budgets? What combination of goods and

services will best fit their needs and wants, given the budget they have to spend? How do people decide

whether to work, and if so, whether to work full time or part time? How do people decide how much to save for

the future, or whether they should borrow to spend beyond their current means?

What determines the products, and how many of each, a firm will produce and sell? What determines the

16 1 • Welcome to Economics!

prices a firm will charge? What determines how a firm will produce its products? What determines how many

workers it will hire? How will a firm finance its business? When will a firm decide to expand, downsize, or even

close? In the microeconomics part of this book, we will learn about the theory of consumer behavior, the

theory of the firm, how markets for labor and other resources work, and how markets sometimes fail to work

properly.

Macroeconomics

What determines the level of economic activity in a society? In other words, what determines how many goods

and services a nation actually produces? What determines how many jobs are available in an economy? What

determines a nation’s standard of living? What causes the economy to speed up or slow down? What causes

firms to hire more workers or to lay them off? Finally, what causes the economy to grow over the long term?

We can determine an economy's macroeconomic health by examining a number of goals: growth in the

standard of living, low unemployment, and low inflation, to name the most important. How can we use

government macroeconomic policy to pursue these goals? A nation's central bank conducts monetary policy,

which involves policies that affect bank lending, interest rates, and financial capital markets. For the United

States, this is the Federal Reserve. A nation's legislative body determines fiscal policy, which involves

government spending and taxes. For the United States, this is the Congress and the executive branch, which

originates the federal budget. These are the government's main tools. Americans tend to expect that

government can fix whatever economic problems we encounter, but to what extent is that expectation

realistic? These are just some of the issues that we will explore in the macroeconomic chapters of this book.

1.3 How Economists Use Theories and Models to Understand Economic Issues

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

•

Interpret a circular flow diagram

• Explain the importance of economic theories and models

• Describe goods and services markets and labor markets

FIGURE 1.6 John Maynard Keynes One of the most influential economists in modern times was John Maynard

Keynes. (Credit: “John Maynard Keynes” by IMF/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)

John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946), one of the greatest economists of the twentieth century, pointed out that

economics is not just a subject area but also a way of thinking. Keynes (Figure 1.6) famously wrote in the

introduction to a fellow economist’s book: “[Economics] is a method rather than a doctrine, an apparatus of the

mind, a technique of thinking, which helps its possessor to draw correct conclusions.” In other words,

economics teaches you how to think, not what to think.

1.3 • How Economists Use Theories and Models to Understand Economic Issues 17

Economists see the world through a different lens than anthropologists, biologists, classicists, or practitioners

of any other discipline. They analyze issues and problems using economic theories that are based on

particular assumptions about human behavior. These assumptions tend to be different than the assumptions

an anthropologist or psychologist might use. A theory is a simplified representation of how two or more

variables interact with each other. The purpose of a theory is to take a complex, real-world issue and simplify it

down to its essentials. If done well, this enables the analyst to understand the issue and any problems around

it. A good theory is simple enough to understand, while complex enough to capture the key features of the

object or situation you are studying.

Sometimes economists use the term model instead of theory. Strictly speaking, a theory is a more abstract

representation, while a model is a more applied or empirical representation. We use models to test theories,

but for this course we will use the terms interchangeably.

For example, an architect who is planning a major office building will often build a physical model that sits on

a tabletop to show how the entire city block will look after the new building is constructed. Companies often

build models of their new products, which are more rough and unfinished than the final product, but can still

demonstrate how the new product will work.

A good model to start with in economics is the circular flow diagram (Figure 1.7). It pictures the economy as

consisting of two groups—households and firms—that interact in two markets: the goods and services market

in which firms sell and households buy and the labor market in which households sell labor to business firms

or other employees.

FIGURE 1.7 The Circular Flow Diagram The circular flow diagram shows how households and firms interact in the

goods and services market, and in the labor market. The direction of the arrows shows that in the goods and

services market, households receive goods and services and pay firms for them. In the labor market, households

provide labor and receive payment from firms through wages, salaries, and benefits.

Firms produce and sell goods and services to households in the market for goods and services (or product

market). Arrow “A” indicates this. Households pay for goods and services, which becomes the revenues to

firms. Arrow “B” indicates this. Arrows A and B represent the two sides of the product market. Where do

households obtain the income to buy goods and services? They provide the labor and other resources (e.g.,

land, capital, raw materials) firms need to produce goods and services in the market for inputs (or factors of

production). Arrow “C” indicates this. In return, firms pay for the inputs (or resources) they use in the form of

wages and other factor payments. Arrow “D” indicates this. Arrows “C” and “D” represent the two sides of the

factor market.

Of course, in the real world, there are many different markets for goods and services and markets for many

different types of labor. The circular flow diagram simplifies this to make the picture easier to grasp. In the

diagram, firms produce goods and services, which they sell to households in return for revenues. The outer

circle shows this, and represents the two sides of the product market (for example, the market for goods and

18 1 • Welcome to Economics!

services) in which households demand and firms supply. Households sell their labor as workers to firms in

return for wages, salaries, and benefits. The inner circle shows this and represents the two sides of the labor

market in which households supply and firms demand.

This version of the circular flow model is stripped down to the essentials, but it has enough features to explain

how the product and labor markets work in the economy. We could easily add details to this basic model if we

wanted to introduce more real-world elements, like financial markets, governments, and interactions with the

rest of the globe (imports and exports).

Economists carry a set of theories in their heads like a carpenter carries around a toolkit. When they see an

economic issue or problem, they go through the theories they know to see if they can find one that fits. Then

they use the theory to derive insights about the issue or problem. Economists express theories as diagrams,

graphs, or even as mathematical equations. (Do not worry. In this course, we will mostly use graphs.)

Economists do not figure out the answer to the problem first and then draw the graph to illustrate. Rather, they

use the graph of the theory to help them figure out the answer. Although at the introductory level, you can

sometimes figure out the right answer without applying a model, if you keep studying economics, before too

long you will run into issues and problems that you will need to graph to solve. We explain both micro and
macroeconomics in terms of theories and models. The most well-known theories are probably those of supply
and demand, but you will learn a number of others.

1.4 How To Organize Economies: An Overview of Economic Systems

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Contrast traditional economies, command economies, and market economies

• Explain gross domestic product (GDP)

• Assess the importance and effects of globalization

Think about what a complex system a modern economy is. It includes all production of goods and services, all

buying and selling, all employment. The economic life of every individual is interrelated, at least to a small

extent, with the economic lives of thousands or even millions of other individuals. Who organizes and

coordinates this system? Who ensures that, for example, the number of televisions a society provides is the

same as the amount it needs and wants? Who ensures that the right number of employees work in the

electronics industry? Who ensures that televisions are produced in the best way possible? How does it all get

done?

There are at least three ways that societies organize an economy. The first is the traditional economy, which is

the oldest economic system and is used in parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. Traditional economies

organize their economic affairs the way they have always done (i.e., tradition). Occupations stay in the family.

Most families are farmers who grow the crops using traditional methods. What you produce is what you

consume. Because tradition drives the way of life, there is little economic progress or development.

Giza" by Jay Bergesen/Flickr Creative Commons, CC BY 2.0)

Command economies are very different. In a command economy, economic effort is devoted to goals passed

down from a ruler or ruling class. Ancient Egypt was a good example: a large part of economic life was devoted

to building pyramids, like those in Figure 1.8, for the pharaohs. Medieval manor life is another example: the

lord provided the land for growing crops and protection in the event of war. In return, vassals provided labor

and soldiers to do the lord’s bidding. In the last century, communism emphasized command economies.

In a command economy, the government decides what goods and services will be produced and what prices it

will charge for them. The government decides what methods of production to use and sets wages for workers.

The government provides many necessities like healthcare and education for free. Currently, Cuba and North

Korea have command economies.

FIGURE 1.9 A Market Economy Nothing says “market” more than The New York Stock Exchange. (Credit: work by

Although command economies have a very centralized structure for economic decisions, market economies

have a very decentralized structure. A market is an institution that brings together buyers and sellers of goods

or services, who may be either individuals or businesses. The New York Stock Exchange (Figure 1.9) is a prime

example of a market which brings buyers and sellers together. In a market economy, decision-making is

decentralized. Market economies are based on private enterprise: the private individuals or groups of private

individuals own and operate the means of production (resources and businesses). Businesses supply goods

and services based on demand. (In a command economy, by contrast, the government owns resources and

businesses.) Supply of goods and services depends on what the demands are. A person’s income is based on

their ability to convert resources (especially labor) into something that society values. The more society values

the person’s output, the higher the income (think Lady Gaga or LeBron James). In this scenario, market forces,

not governments, determine economic decisions.

Most economies in the real world are mixed. They combine elements of command and market (and even

traditional) systems. The U.S. economy is positioned toward the market-oriented end of the spectrum. Many

countries in Europe and Latin America, while primarily market-oriented, have a greater degree of government

20 1 • Welcome to Economics!

involvement in economic decisions than the U.S. economy. China and Russia, while over the past several

decades have moved more in the direction of having a market-oriented system, remain closer to the command

economy end of the spectrum. The Heritage Foundation provides perspective on countries’ economic freedom,

as the following Clear It Up feature discusses.

CLEAR IT UP

What countries are considered economically free?
Who is in control of economic decisions? Are people free to do what they want and to work where they want? Are

businesses free to produce when they want and what they choose, and to hire and fire as they wish? Are banks free

to choose who will receive loans, or does the government control these kinds of choices? Each year, researchers at

the Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journallook at 50 different categories of economic freedom for

countries around the world. They give each nation a score based on the extent of economic freedom in each

category. Note that while the Heritage Foundation/WSJ index is widely cited by an array of scholars and

publications, it should be regarded as only one viewpoint. Some experts indicate that the index’s category choices

and scores are politically biased. However, the index and others like it provide a useful resource for critical
discussion of economic freedom.

The 2016 Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic Freedom report ranked 178 countries around the world: Table

1.1 lists some examples of the most free and the least free countries. Although technically not a separate country,

Hong Kong has been granted a degree of autonomy such that, for purposes of measuring economic statistics, it is

often treated as a separate country. Several additional countries were not ranked because of extreme instability that

made judgments about economic freedom impossible. These countries include Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria,

Somalia, and Yemen.

The assigned rankings are inevitably based on estimates, yet even these rough measures can be useful for

discerning trends. In 2015, 101 of the 178 included countries shifted toward greater economic freedom, although

77 of the countries shifted toward less economic freedom. In recent decades, the overall trend has been a higher

level of economic freedom around the world.

Regulations: The Rules of the Game

Markets and government regulations are always entangled. There is no such thing as an absolutely free

market. Regulations always define the “rules of the game” in the economy. Economies that are primarily

market-oriented have fewer regulations—ideally just enough to maintain an even playing field for participants.
At a minimum, these laws govern matters like safeguarding private property against theft, protecting people

from violence, enforcing legal contracts, preventing fraud, and collecting taxes. Conversely, even the most

command-oriented economies operate using markets. How else would buying and selling occur? The

government heavily regulates decisions of what to produce and prices to charge. Heavily regulated economies

often have underground economies (or black markets), which are markets where the buyers and sellers make

transactions without the government’s approval.

The question of how to organize economic institutions is typically not a straightforward choice between all

market or all government, but instead involves a balancing act over the appropriate combination of market

freedom and government rules.

FIGURE 1.10 Globalization Cargo ships are one mode of transportation for shipping goods in the global economy.

The Rise of Globalization

Recent decades have seen a trend toward globalization, which is the expanding cultural, political, and

economic connections between people around the world. One measure of this is the increased buying and

selling of goods, services, and assets across national borders—in other words, international trade and financial

capital flows.

Globalization has occurred for a number of reasons. Improvements in shipping, as illustrated by the container

ship in Figure 1.10, and air cargo have driven down transportation costs. Innovations in computing and

22 1 • Welcome to Economics!

telecommunications have made it easier and cheaper to manage long-distance economic connections of

production and sales. Many valuable products and services in the modern economy can take the form of

information—for example: computer software; financial advice; travel planning; music, books and movies; and

blueprints for designing a building. These products and many others can be transported over telephones and

computer networks at ever-lower costs. Finally, international agreements and treaties between countries have

encouraged greater trade.

Table 1.2 presents one measure of globalization. It shows the percentage of domestic economic production

that was exported for a selection of countries from 2010 to 2015, according to an entity known as The World

Bank. Exports are the goods and services that one produces domestically and sells abroad. Imports are the

goods and services that one produces abroad and then sells domestically. Gross domestic product (GDP)

measures the size of total production in an economy. Thus, the ratio of exports divided by GDP measures what

share of a country’s total economic production is sold in other countries.

TABLE 1.2 The Extent of Globalization (exports/GDP)

(Source: http://databank.worldbank.org/data/)

-

-

In recent decades, the export/GDP ratio has generally risen, both worldwide and for the U.S. economy.

Interestingly, the share of U.S. exports in proportion to the U.S. economy is well below the global average, in

part because large economies like the United States can contain more of the division of labor inside their
national borders. However, smaller economies like Belgium, Korea, and Canada need to trade across their

borders with other countries to take full advantage of division of labor, specialization, and economies of scale.

In this sense, the enormous U.S. economy is less affected by globalization than most other countries.

Table 1.2 indicates that many medium and low income countries around the world, like Mexico and China,

1.4 • How To Organize Economies: An Overview of Economic Systems 23

have also experienced a surge of globalization in recent decades. If an astronaut in orbit could put on special

glasses that make all economic transactions visible as brightly colored lines and look down at Earth, the

astronaut would see the planet covered with connections.

Despite the rise in globalization over the last few decades, in recent years we've seen significant pushback

against globalization from people across the world concerned about loss of jobs, loss of political sovereignty,

and increased economic inequality. Prominent examples of this pushback include the 2016 vote in Great

Britain to exit the European Union (i.e. Brexit), and the election of Donald J. Trump for President of the United

States.

Hopefully, you now have an idea about economics. Before you move to any other chapter of study, be sure to

read the very important appendix to this chapter called The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics. It

is essential that you learn more about how to read and use models in economics.

BRING IT HOME

Information Overload in the Information Age
The world provides nearly instant access to a wealth of information. Consider that as recently as the late 1970s, the
Farmer’s Almanac, along with the Weather Bureau of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, were the primary sources

American farmers used to determine when to plant and harvest their crops. Today, these decisions are driven by

data. Farmers access detailed data streams driven by global positioning systems, historical rainfall patterns, and

complex weather monitoring services. They combine this information with crop yield data and soil quality

measurements from prior years. Maximizing production efficiently can mean the difference between a farm that

remains profitable and one that may need to sell its land, and data helps eliminate guesswork.

Information helps us make decisions as simple as what to wear today to how many reporters the media should send

to cover an event. Each of these decisions is an economic decision. After all, resources are scarce. If the media send

ten reporters to cover an announcement, they are not available to cover other stories or complete other tasks.

Information provides the necessary knowledge to make the best possible decisions on how to utilize scarce

resources. Welcome to the world of economics!

Key Concepts and Summary

1.1 What Is Economics, and Why Is It Important?

Economics seeks to solve the problem of scarcity, which is when human wants for goods and services exceed

the available supply. A modern economy displays a division of labor, in which people earn income by

specializing in what they produce and then use that income to purchase the products they need or want. The

division of labor allows individuals and firms to specialize and to produce more for several reasons: a) It allows
the agents to focus on areas of advantage due to natural factors and skill levels; b) It encourages the agents to

learn and invent; c) It allows agents to take advantage of economies of scale. Division and specialization of

labor only work when individuals can purchase what they do not produce in markets. Learning about

economics helps you understand the major problems facing the world today, prepares you to be a good citizen,

and helps you become a well-rounded thinker.

1 • Self-Check Questions 25

1.2 Microeconomics and Macroeconomics

Microeconomics and macroeconomics are two different perspectives on the economy. The microeconomic

perspective focuses on parts of the economy: individuals, firms, and industries. The macroeconomic

perspective looks at the economy as a whole, focusing on goals like growth in the standard of living,

unemployment, and inflation. Macroeconomics has two types of policies for pursuing these goals: monetary

policy and fiscal policy.

1.3 How Economists Use Theories and Models to Understand Economic Issues

Economists analyze problems differently than do other disciplinary experts. The main tools economists use

are economic theories or models. A theory is not an illustration of the answer to a problem. Rather, a theory is a

tool for determining the answer.

1.4 How To Organize Economies: An Overview of Economic Systems

We can organize societies as traditional, command, or market-oriented economies. Most societies are a mix.

that cross national borders, making businesses and workers from different economies increasingly

interdependent.

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES

In this chapter, you will learn about:

• How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget Constraint

• The Production Possibilities Frontier and Social Choices

• Confronting Objections to the Economic Approach

Introduction to Choice in a World of Scarcity

BRING IT HOME

Choices ... to What Degree?
Does your level of education impact earning? Let’s look at some data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). In

2020, among full-time wage and salary workers, median weekly earnings for those with a master’s degree were

$1,545. Multiply this average by 52 weeks, and you get average annual earnings of $80,340. Compare that to the

28 2 • Choice in a World of Scarcity

median weekly earnings for full-time workers aged 25 and over with just a bachelor’s degree: $1,305 weekly and

$67,860 a year. What about those with no higher than a high school diploma in 2020? They earn an average of just

$781 weekly and $40,612 over 12 months. In other words, data from the BLS indicates that receiving a bachelor’s

degree boosts earnings by 67% over what workers would have earned if they only obtained a high school diploma,

and a master’s degree yields average earnings that are nearly double those of workers with a high school diploma.

Given these statistics, we might expect many people to choose to go to college and at least earn a bachelor’s

degree. Assuming that people want to improve their material well-being, it seems like they would make those

choices that provide them with the greatest opportunity to consume goods and services. As it turns out, the analysis

is not nearly as simple as this. In fact, in 2019, the BLS reported that while just over 90% of the population aged 25

and over in the United States had a high school diploma, only 36% of those aged 25 and over had a bachelor's or

higher degree, and only 13.5% had earned a master's or higher degree.

This brings us to the subject of this chapter: why people make the choices they make and how economists explain

those choices.

You will learn quickly when you examine the relationship between economics and scarcity that choices involve

tradeoffs. Every choice has a cost.

In 1968, the Rolling Stones recorded “You Can’t Always Get What You Want.” Economists chuckled, because

they had been singing a similar tune for decades. English economist Lionel Robbins (1898–1984), in his Essay

on the Nature and Significance of Economic Sciencein 1932, described not always getting what you want in

this way:

The time at our disposal is limited. There are only twenty-four hours in the day. We have to choose

between the different uses to which they may be put. ... Everywhere we turn, if we choose one thing we

must relinquish others which, in different circumstances, we would wish not to have relinquished.

Scarcity of means to satisfy given ends is an almost ubiquitous condition of human nature.

Because people live in a world of scarcity, they cannot have all the time, money, possessions, and experiences

they wish. Neither can society.

This chapter will continue our discussion of scarcity and the economic way of thinking by first introducing

three critical concepts: opportunity cost, marginal decision making, and diminishing returns. Later, it will

consider whether the economic way of thinking accurately describes either how we makechoices and how we

shouldmake them.

2.1 How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget Constraint

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Calculate and graph budget constraints

• Explain opportunity sets and opportunity costs

• Evaluate the law of diminishing marginal utility

• Explain how marginal analysis and utility influence choices

Consider the typical consumer’s budget problem. Consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the

things they need and want. Suppose Alphonso has $10 in spending money each week that he can allocate

between bus tickets for getting to work and the burgers that he eats for lunch. Burgers cost $2 each, and bus

tickets are 50 cents each. We can see Alphonso's budget problem in Figure 2.2.

Access for free at openstax.org

2.1 • How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget Constraint 29

FIGURE 2.2 The Budget Constraint: Alphonso’s Consumption Choice Opportunity Frontier Each point on the

budget constraint represents a combination of burgers and bus tickets whose total cost adds up to Alphonso’s

budget of $10. The relative price of burgers and bus tickets determines the slope of the budget constraint. All along

the budget set, giving up one burger means gaining four bus tickets.

The vertical axis in the figure shows burger purchases and the horizontal axis shows bus ticket purchases. If

Alphonso spends all his money on burgers, he can afford five per week. ($10 per week/$2 per burger = 5

burgers per week.) However, if he does this, he will not be able to afford any bus tickets. Point A in the figure

shows the choice (zero bus tickets and five burgers). Alternatively, if Alphonso spends all his money on bus

tickets, he can afford 20 per week. ($10 per week/$0.50 per bus ticket = 20 bus tickets per week.) Then,

however, he will not be able to afford any burgers. Point F shows this alternative choice (20 bus tickets and zero

burgers).

If we connect all the points between A and F, we get Alphonso's budget constraint. This indicates all the

combination of burgers and bus tickets Alphonso can afford, given the price of the two goods and his budget

amount.

If Alphonso is like most people, he will choose some combination that includes both bus tickets and burgers.

That is, he will choose some combination on the budget constraint that is between points A and F. Every point

on (or inside) the constraint shows a combination of burgers and bus tickets that Alphonso can afford. Any

point outside the constraint is not affordable, because it would cost more money than Alphonso has in his

budget.

The budget constraint clearly shows the tradeoff Alphonso faces in choosing between burgers and bus tickets.

Suppose he is currently at point D, where he can afford 12 bus tickets and two burgers. What would it cost

Alphonso for one more burger? It would be natural to answer $2, but that’s not the way economists think.

Instead they ask, how many bus tickets would Alphonso have to give up to get one more burger, while staying

within his budget? Since bus tickets cost 50 cents, Alphonso would have to give up four to afford one more

burger. That is the true cost to Alphonso.

The Concept of Opportunity Cost

Economists use the term opportunity cost to indicate what people must give up to obtain what they desire.

The idea behind opportunity cost is that the cost of one item is the lost opportunity to do or consume

something else. In short, opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative. For Alphonso, the

opportunity cost of a burger is the four bus tickets he would have to give up. He would decide whether or not to

choose the burger depending on whether the value of the burger exceeds the value of the forgone

alternative—in this case, bus tickets. Since people must choose, they inevitably face tradeoffs in which they

have to give up things they desire to obtain other things they desire more.

View this website (http://openstax.org/l/linestanding) for an example of opportunity cost—paying someone else

to wait in line for you.

30 2 • Choice in a World of Scarcity

A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost. If you sleep through your

economics class, the opportunity cost is the learning you miss from not attending class. If you spend your

income on video games, you cannot spend it on movies. If you choose to marry one person, you give up the

opportunity to marry anyone else. In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.

The following Work It Out feature shows a step-by-step analysis of a budget constraint calculation. Read

through it to understand another important concept—slope—that we further explain in the appendix The Use

of Mathematics in Principles of Economics.

WORK IT OUT

Understanding Budget Constraints
Budget constraints are easy to understand if you apply a little math. The appendix The Use of Mathematics in

Principles of Economics explains all the math you are likely to need in this book. Therefore, if math is not your

strength, you might want to take a look at the appendix.

Step 1: The equation for any budget constraint is:

where P and Q are the price and quantity of items purchased (which we assume here to be two items) and

Budget is the amount of income one has to spend.

Step 2. Apply the budget constraint equation to the scenario. In Alphonso’s case, this works out to be:

Step 3. Using a little algebra, we can turn this into the familiar equation of a line:

For Alphonso, this is:

Step 4. Simplify the equation. Begin by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

Step 5. Subtract one bus ticket from both sides:

Divide each side by 4 to yield the answer:

Step 6. Notice that this equation fits the budget constraint in Figure 2.2. The vertical intercept is 5 and the slope

is –0.25, just as the equation says. If you plug 20 bus tickets into the equation, you get 0 burgers. If you plug

other numbers of bus tickets into the equation, you get the results (see Table 2.1), which are the points on

Alphonso’s budget constraint.

Step 7. Notice that the slope of a budget constraint always shows the opportunity cost of the good which is on

the horizontal axis. For Alphonso, the slope is −0.25, indicating that for every bus ticket he buys, he must give up

1/4 burger. To phrase it differently, for every four tickets he buys, Alphonso must give up 1 burger.

There are two important observations here. First, the algebraic sign of the slope is negative, which means that

the only way to get more of one good is to give up some of the other. Second, we define the slope as the price of

bus tickets (whatever is on the horizontal axis in the graph) divided by the price of burgers (whatever is on the

vertical axis), in this case $0.50/$2 = 0.25. If you want to determine the opportunity cost quickly, just divide the

two prices.

Identifying Opportunity Cost

In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price. If your cousin buys a new bicycle for

$300, then $300 measures the amount of “other consumption” that he has forsaken. For practical purposes,

there may be no special need to identify the specific alternative product or products that he could have bought

with that $300, but sometimes the price as measured in dollars may not accurately capture the true

opportunity cost. This problem can loom especially large when costs of time are involved.

For example, consider a boss who decides that all employees will attend a two-day retreat to “build team

spirit.” The out-of-pocket monetary cost of the event may involve hiring an outside consulting firm to run the

retreat, as well as room and board for all participants. However, an opportunity cost exists as well: during the
two days of the retreat, none of the employees are doing any other work.

Attending college is another case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. The out-of-pocket

costs of attending college include tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. However, in addition,

during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a paying job. Thus,

college imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost earnings.

CLEAR IT UP

What is the opportunity cost associated with increased airport security measures?
After the terrorist plane hijackings on September 11, 2001, many steps were proposed to improve air travel safety.

For example, the federal government could provide armed “sky marshals” who would travel inconspicuously with

the rest of the passengers. The cost of having a sky marshal on every flight would be roughly $3 billion per year.

Retrofitting all U.S. planes with reinforced cockpit doors to make it harder for terrorists to take over the plane would

32 2 • Choice in a World of Scarcity

have a price tag of $450 million. Buying more sophisticated security equipment for airports, like three-dimensional

baggage scanners and cameras linked to face recognition software, could cost another $2 billion.

However, the single biggest cost of greater airline security does not involve spending money. It is the opportunity

cost of additional waiting time at the airport. According to the United States Department of Transportation (DOT),

there were 895.5 million systemwide (domestic and international) scheduled service passengers in 2015. Since the

9/11 hijackings, security screening has become more intensive, and consequently, the procedure takes longer than

in the past. Say that, on average, each air passenger spends an extra 30 minutes in the airport per trip. Economists

commonly place a value on time to convert an opportunity cost in time into a monetary figure. Because many air

travelers are relatively high-paid business people, conservative estimates set the average price of time for air

travelers at $20 per hour. By these back-of-the-envelope calculations, the opportunity cost of delays in airports

could be as much as 800 million × 0.5 hours × $20/hour, or $8 billion per year. Clearly, the opportunity costs of

waiting time can be just as important as costs that involve direct spending.

In some cases, realizing the opportunity cost can alter behavior. Imagine, for example, that you spend $8 on

lunch every day at work. You may know perfectly well that bringing a lunch from home would cost only $3 a

day, so the opportunity cost of buying lunch at the restaurant is $5 each day (that is, the $8 buying lunch costs
minus the $3 your lunch from home would cost). Five dollars each day does not seem to be that much.

However, if you project what that adds up to in a year—250 days a year × $5 per day equals $1,250, the cost,

perhaps, of a decent vacation. If you describe the opportunity cost as “a nice vacation” instead of “$5 a day,”

you might make different choices.

Marginal Decision-Making and Diminishing Marginal Utility

The budget constraint framework helps to emphasize that most choices in the real world are not about getting

all of one thing or all of another; that is, they are not about choosing either the point at one end of the budget

constraint or else the point all the way at the other end. Instead, most choices involve marginal analysis,

which means examining the benefits and costs of choosing a little more or a little less of a good. People

naturally compare costs and benefits, but often we look at total costs and total benefits, when the optimal

choice necessitates comparing how costs and benefits change from one option to another. You might think of

marginal analysis as “change analysis.” Marginal analysis is used throughout economics.

We now turn to the notion of utility. People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility those goods

and services provide. Utility, as we will see in the chapter on Consumer Choices (http://openstax.org/books/

principles-economics-3e/pages/6-introduction-to-consumer-choices), is subjective but that does not make it

less real. Economists typically assume that the more of some good one consumes (for example, slices of pizza),

the more utility one obtains. At the same time, the utility a person receives from consuming the first unit of a
good is typically more than the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good.

When Alphonso chooses between burgers and bus tickets, for example, the first few bus rides that he chooses

might provide him with a great deal of utility—perhaps they help him get to a job interview or a doctor’s

appointment. However, later bus rides might provide much less utility—they may only serve to kill time on a

rainy day. Similarly, the first burger that Alphonso chooses to buy may be on a day when he missed breakfast

and is ravenously hungry. However, if Alphonso has multiple burgers every day, the last few burgers may taste

pretty boring. The general pattern that consumption of the first few units of any good tends to bring a higher

level of utility to a person than consumption of later units is a common pattern. Economists refer to this

pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility, which means that as a person receives more of a good, the

additional (or marginal) utility from each additional unit of the good declines. In other words, the first slice of

pizza brings more satisfaction than the sixth.

The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing choices.

You would not say, “My favorite food is ice cream, so I will eat nothing but ice cream from now on.” Instead,

even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the additional or

Access for free at openstax.org

2.1 • How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget Constraint 33

marginal utility from those last few servings would not be very high. Similarly, most workers do not say: “I

enjoy leisure, so I’ll never work.” Instead, workers recognize that even though some leisure is very nice, a

combination of all leisure and no income is not so attractive. The budget constraint framework suggests that

when people make choices in a world of scarcity, they will use marginal analysis and think about whether they

would prefer a little more or a little less.

A rational consumer would only purchase additional units of some product as long as the marginal utility

exceeds the opportunity cost. Suppose Alphonso moves down his budget constraint from Point A to Point B to

Point C and further. As he consumes more bus tickets, the marginal utility of bus tickets will diminish, while

the opportunity cost, that is, the marginal utility of foregone burgers, will increase. Eventually, the opportunity

cost will exceed the marginal utility of an additional bus ticket. If Alphonso is rational, he won’t purchase more

bus tickets once the marginal utility just equals the opportunity cost. While we can’t (yet) say exactly how many

bus tickets Alphonso will buy, that number is unlikely to be the most he can afford, 20.

Sunk Costs

In the budget constraint framework, all decisions involve what will happen next: that is, what quantities of

goods will you consume, how many hours will you work, or how much will you save. These decisions do not

look back to past choices. Thus, the budget constraint framework assumes that sunk costs, which are costs

that were incurred in the past and cannot be recovered, should not affect the current decision.

Consider the case of Selena, who pays $8 to see a movie, but after watching the film for 30 minutes, she knows

that it is truly terrible. Should she stay and watch the rest of the movie because she paid for the ticket, or

should she leave? The money she spent is a sunk cost, and unless the theater manager is sympathetic, Selena

will not get a refund. However, staying in the movie still means paying an opportunity cost in time. Her choice

is whether to spend the next 90 minutes suffering through a cinematic disaster or to do

something—anything—else. The lesson of sunk costs is to forget about the money and time that is irretrievably

gone and instead to focus on the marginal costs and benefits of current and future options.

For people and firms alike, dealing with sunk costs can be frustrating. It often means admitting an earlier error

in judgment. Many firms, for example, find it hard to give up on a new product that is doing poorly because

they spent so much money in creating and launching the product. However, the lesson of sunk costs is to

ignore them and make decisions based on what will happen in the future.

From a Model with Two Goods to One of Many Goods

The budget constraint diagram containing just two goods, like most models used in this book, is not realistic.

After all, in a modern economy people choose from thousands of goods. However, thinking about a model with

many goods is a straightforward extension of what we discussed here. Instead of drawing just one budget
constraint, showing the tradeoff between two goods, you can draw multiple budget constraints, showing the

possible tradeoffs between many different pairs of goods. In more advanced classes in economics, you would

use mathematical equations that include many possible goods and services that can be purchased, together

with their quantities and prices, and show how the total spending on all goods and services is limited to the

overall budget available. The graph with two goods that we presented here clearly illustrates that every choice

has an opportunity cost, which is the point that does carry over to the real world.

2.2 The Production Possibilities Frontier and Social Choices

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•

Interpret production possibilities frontier graphs

• Contrast a budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier

• Explain the relationship between a production possibilities frontier and the law of diminishing returns

• Contrast productive efficiency and allocative efficiency

• Define comparative advantage

Just as individuals cannot have everything they want and must instead make choices, society as a whole

cannot have everything it might want, either. This section of the chapter will explain the constraints society

faces, using a model called the production possibilities frontier (PPF). There are more similarities than

differences between individual choice and social choice. As you read this section, focus on the similarities.

Because society has limited resources (e.g., labor, land, capital, raw materials) at any point in time, there is a

limit to the quantities of goods and services it can produce. Suppose a society desires two products, healthcare

and education. The production possibilities frontier in Figure 2.3 illustrates this situation.

FIGURE 2.3 A Healthcare vs. Education Production Possibilities Frontier This production possibilities frontier

shows a tradeoff between devoting social resources to healthcare and devoting them to education. At A all

resources go to healthcare and at B, most go to healthcare. At D most resources go to education, and at F, all go to

education.

Figure 2.3 shows healthcare on the vertical axis and education on the horizontal axis. If the society were to
allocate all of its resources to healthcare, it could produce at point A. However, it would not have any resources

to produce education. If it were to allocate all of its resources to education, it could produce at point F.

Alternatively, the society could choose to produce any combination of healthcare and education on the

production possibilities frontier. In effect, the production possibilities frontier plays the same role for society

as the budget constraint plays for Alphonso. Society can choose any combination of the two goods on or inside

the PPF. However, it does not have enough resources to produce outside the PPF.

Most importantly, the production possibilities frontier clearly shows the tradeoff between healthcare and

education. Suppose society has chosen to operate at point B, and it is considering producing more education.

Because the PPF is downward sloping from left to right, the only way society can obtain more education is by

giving up some healthcare. That is the tradeoff society faces. Suppose it considers moving from point B to

point C. What would the opportunity cost be for the additional education? The opportunity cost would be the

healthcare society has to forgo. Just as with Alphonso’s budget constraint, the slope of the production

possibilities frontier shows the opportunity cost. By now you might be saying, “Hey, this PPF is sounding like

the budget constraint.” If so, read the following Clear It Up feature.

2.2 • The Production Possibilities Frontier and Social Choices 35

CLEAR IT UP

What’s the difference between a budget constraint and a PPF?
There are two major differences between a budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier. The first is the

fact that the budget constraint is a straight line. This is because its slope is given by the relative prices of the two

goods, which from the point of view of an individual consumer, are fixed, so the slope doesn't change. In contrast,

the PPF has a curved shape because of the law of the diminishing returns. Thus, the slope is different at various

points on the PPF. The second major difference is the absence of specific numbers on the axes of the PPF. There are

no specific numbers because we do not know the exact amount of resources this imaginary economy has, nor do we

know how many resources it takes to produce healthcare and how many resources it takes to produce education. If

this were a real world example, that data would be available.

Whether or not we have specific numbers, conceptually we can measure the opportunity cost of additional

education as society moves from point B to point C on the PPF. We measure the additional education by the

horizontal distance between B and C. The foregone healthcare is given by the vertical distance between B and C. The

slope of the PPF between B and C is (approximately) the vertical distance (the “rise”) over the horizontal distance
(the “run”). This is the opportunity cost of the additional education.

The PPF and the Law of Increasing Opportunity Cost

The budget constraints that we presented earlier in this chapter, showing individual choices about what

quantities of goods to consume, were all straight lines. The reason for these straight lines was that the relative

prices of the two goods in the consumption budget constraint determined the slope of the budget constraint.

However, we drew the production possibilities frontier for healthcare and education as a curved line. Why does

the PPF have a different shape?

To understand why the PPF is curved, start by considering point A at the top left-hand side of the PPF. At point

A, all available resources are devoted to healthcare and none are left for education. This situation would be

extreme and even ridiculous. For example, children are seeing a doctor every day, whether they are sick or not,

but not attending school. People are having cosmetic surgery on every part of their bodies, but no high school

or college education exists. Now imagine that some of these resources are diverted from healthcare to

education, so that the economy is at point B instead of point A. Diverting some resources away from A to B

causes relatively little reduction in health because the last few marginal dollars going into healthcare services

are not producing much additional gain in health. However, putting those marginal dollars into education,

which is completely without resources at point A, can produce relatively large gains. For this reason, the shape

of the PPF from A to B is relatively flat, representing a relatively small drop-off in health and a relatively large

gain in education.

Now consider the other end, at the lower right, of the production possibilities frontier. Imagine that society

starts at choice D, which is devoting nearly all resources to education and very few to healthcare, and moves to

point F, which is devoting allspending to education and none to healthcare. For the sake of concreteness, you

can imagine that in the movement from D to F, the last few doctors must become high school science teachers,

the last few nurses must become school librarians rather than dispensers of vaccinations, and the last few

emergency rooms are turned into kindergartens. The gains to education from adding these last few resources

to education are very small. However, the opportunity cost lost to health will be fairly large, and thus the slope

of the PPF between D and F is steep, showing a large drop in health for only a small gain in education.

The lesson is not that society is likely to make an extreme choice like devoting no resources to education at

point A or no resources to health at point F. Instead, the lesson is that the gains from committing additional

marginal resources to education depend on how much is already being spent. If on the one hand, very few

resources are currently committed to education, then an increase in resources used for education can bring

36 2 • Choice in a World of Scarcity

relatively large gains. On the other hand, if a large number of resources are already committed to education,

then committing additional resources will bring relatively smaller gains.

This pattern is common enough that economists have given it a name: the law of increasing opportunity cost,

which holds that as production of a good or service increases, the marginal opportunity cost of producing it

increases as well. This happens because some resources are better suited for producing certain goods and

services instead of others. When government spends a certain amount more on reducing crime, for example,

the original increase in opportunity cost of reducing crime could be relatively small. However, additional

increases typically cause relatively larger increases in the opportunity cost of reducing crime, and paying for

enough police and security to reduce crime to nothing at all would be a tremendously high opportunity cost.

The curvature of the production possibilities frontier shows that as we add more resources to education,

moving from left to right along the horizontal axis, the original increase in opportunity cost is fairly small, but

gradually increases. Thus, the slope of the PPF is relatively flat near the vertical-axis intercept. Conversely, as

we add more resources to healthcare, moving from bottom to top on the vertical axis, the original declines in

opportunity cost are fairly large, but again gradually diminish. Thus, the slope of the PPF is relatively steep

near the horizontal-axis intercept. In this way, the law of increasing opportunity cost produces the outward-
bending shape of the production possibilities frontier.

Productive Efficiency and Allocative Efficiency

The study of economics does not presume to tell a society what choice it should make along its production

possibilities frontier. In a market-oriented economy with a democratic government, the choice will involve a

mixture of decisions by individuals, firms, and government. However, economics can point out that some

choices are unambiguously better than others. This observation is based on the concept of efficiency. In

everyday usage, efficiency refers to lack of waste. An inefficient machine operates at high cost, while an

efficient machine operates at lower cost, because it is not wasting energy or materials. An inefficient

organization operates with long delays and high costs, while an efficient organization meets schedules, is

focused, and performs within budget.

The production possibilities frontier can illustrate two kinds of efficiency: productive efficiency and allocative

efficiency. Figure 2.4 illustrates these ideas using a production possibilities frontier between healthcare and

education.

FIGURE 2.4 Productive and Allocative Efficiency Productive efficiency means it is impossible to produce more of

one good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good. Thus, all choices along a given PPF like

B, C, and D display productive efficiency, but R does not. Allocative efficiency means that the particular mix of goods

being produced—that is, the specific choice along the production possibilities frontier—represents the allocation

that society most desires.

2.2 • The Production Possibilities Frontier and Social Choices 37

Productive efficiency means that, given the available inputs and technology, it is impossible to produce more

of one good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good. All choices on the PPF in Figure

2.4, including A, B, C, D, and F, display productive efficiency. As a firm moves from any one of these choices to

any other, either healthcare increases and education decreases or vice versa. However, any choice inside the

production possibilities frontier is productively inefficient and wasteful because it is possible to produce more

of one good, the other good, or some combination of both goods.

For example, point R is productively inefficient because it is possible at choice C to have more of both goods:
education on the horizontal axis is higher at point C than point R (E2 is greater than E1), and healthcare on the
vertical axis is also higher at point C than point R (H2 is great than H1).

We can show the particular mix of goods and services produced—that is, the specific combination of selected

healthcare and education along the production possibilities frontier—as a ray (line) from the origin to a specific

point on the PPF. Output mixes that had more healthcare (and less education) would have a steeper ray, while

those with more education (and less healthcare) would have a flatter ray.

Allocative efficiency means that the particular combination of goods and services on the production

possibility curve that a society produces represents the combination that society most desires. How to

determine what a society desires can be a controversial question, and is usually a discussion in political

science, sociology, and philosophy classes as well as in economics. At its most basic, allocative efficiency

means producers supply the quantity of each product that consumers demand. Only one of the productively

efficient choices will be the allocatively efficient choice for society as a whole.

Why Society Must Choose

In Welcome to Economics! we learned that every society faces the problem of scarcity, where limited resources

conflict with unlimited needs and wants. The production possibilities curve illustrates the choices involved in

this dilemma.

Every economy faces two situations in which it may be able to expand consumption of all goods. In the first

case, a society may discover that it has been using its resources inefficiently, in which case by improving

efficiency and producing on the production possibilities frontier, it can have more of all goods (or at least more

of some and less of none). In the second case, as resources grow over a period of years (e.g., more labor and

more capital), the economy grows. As it does, the production possibilities frontier for a society will tend to shift

outward and society will be able to afford more of all goods. In addition, over time, improvements in

technology can increase the level of production with given resources, and hence push out the PPF.

However, improvements in productive efficiency take time to discover and implement, and economic growth

happens only gradually. Thus, a society must choose between tradeoffs in the present. For government, this
process often involves trying to identify where additional spending could do the most good and where

reductions in spending would do the least harm. At the individual and firm level, the market economy

coordinates a process in which firms seek to produce goods and services in the quantity, quality, and price that

people want. However, for both the government and the market economy in the short term, increases in

production of one good typically mean offsetting decreases somewhere else in the economy.

The PPF and Comparative Advantage

While every society must choose how much of each good or service it should produce, it does not need to

produce every single good it consumes. Often how much of a good a country decides to produce depends on

how expensive it is to produce it versus buying it from a different country. As we saw earlier, the curvature of a

country’s PPF gives us information about the tradeoff between devoting resources to producing one good

versus another. In particular, its slope gives the opportunity cost of producing one more unit of the good in the

x-axis in terms of the other good (in the y-axis). Countries tend to have different opportunity costs of producing

a specific good, either because of different climates, geography, technology, or skills.

38 2 • Choice in a World of Scarcity

Suppose two countries, the US and Brazil, need to decide how much they will produce of two crops: sugar cane

and wheat. Due to its climatic conditions, Brazil can produce quite a bit of sugar cane per acre but not much

wheat. Conversely, the U.S. can produce large amounts of wheat per acre, but not much sugar cane. Clearly,

Brazil has a lower opportunity cost of producing sugar cane (in terms of wheat) than the U.S. The reverse is

also true: the U.S. has a lower opportunity cost of producing wheat than Brazil. We illustrate this by the PPFs of

the two countries in Figure 2.5.

FIGURE 2.5 Production Possibility Frontier for the U.S. and Brazil The U.S. PPF is flatter than the Brazil PPF implying

that the opportunity cost of wheat in terms of sugar cane is lower in the U.S. than in Brazil. Conversely, the

opportunity cost of sugar cane is lower in Brazil. The U.S. has comparative advantage in wheat and Brazil has

comparative advantage in sugar cane.

When a country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another country, we say that this country

has a comparative advantage in that good. Comparative advantage is not the same as absolute advantage,

which is when a country can produce more of a good. In our example, Brazil has an absolute advantage in

sugar cane and the U.S. has an absolute advantage in wheat. One can easily see this with a simple observation

of the extreme production points in the PPFs of the two countries. If Brazil devoted all of its resources to

producing wheat, it would be producing at point A. If however it had devoted all of its resources to producing

sugar cane instead, it would be producing a much larger amount than the U.S., at point B.

The slope of the PPF gives the opportunity cost of producing an additional unit of wheat. While the slope is not

constant throughout the PPFs, it is quite apparent that the PPF in Brazil is much steeper than in the U.S., and

therefore the opportunity cost of wheat is generally higher in Brazil. In the chapter on International Trade you

will learn that countries’ differences in comparative advantage determine which goods they will choose to

produce and trade. When countries engage in trade, they specialize in the production of the goods in which

they have comparative advantage, and trade part of that production for goods in which they do not have

comparative advantage. With trade, manufacturers produce goods where the opportunity cost is lowest, so

total production increases, benefiting both trading parties.

2.3 Confronting Objections to the Economic Approach

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Analyze arguments against economic approaches to decision-making

•

Interpret a tradeoff diagram

• Contrast normative statements and positive statements

It is one thing to understand the economic approach to decision-making and another thing to feel comfortable

applying it. The sources of discomfort typically fall into two categories: that people do not act in the way that

fits the economic way of thinking, and that even if people did act that way, they should try not to. Let’s consider

these arguments in turn.

First Objection: People, Firms, and Society Do Not Act Like This

The economic approach to decision-making seems to require more information than most individuals possess

and more careful decision-making than most individuals actually display. After all, do you or any of your

friends draw a budget constraint and mutter to yourself about maximizing utility before you head to the

shopping mall? Do members of the U.S. Congress contemplate production possibilities frontiers before they
vote on the annual budget? The messy ways in which people and societies operate somehow doesn’t look much

like neat budget constraints or smoothly curving production possibilities frontiers.

However, the economics approach can be a useful way to analyze and understand the tradeoffs of economic

decisions. To appreciate this point, imagine for a moment that you are playing basketball, dribbling to the

right, and throwing a bounce-pass to the left to a teammate who is running toward the basket. A physicist or

engineer could work out the correct speed and trajectory for the pass, given the different movements involved

and the weight and bounciness of the ball. However, when you are playing basketball, you do not perform any

of these calculations. You just pass the ball, and if you are a good player, you will do so with high accuracy.

Someone might argue: “The scientist’s formula of the bounce-pass requires a far greater knowledge of physics

and far more specific information about speeds of movement and weights than the basketball player actually

has, so it must be an unrealistic description of how basketball passes actually occur.” This reaction would be

wrongheaded. The fact that a good player can throw the ball accurately because of practice and skill, without

making a physics calculation, does not mean that the physics calculation is wrong.

Similarly, from an economic point of view, someone who shops for groceries every week has a great deal of

practice with how to purchase the combination of goods that will provide that person with utility, even if the

shopper does not phrase decisions in terms of a budget constraint. Government institutions may work

imperfectly and slowly, but in general, a democratic form of government feels pressure from voters and social
institutions to make the choices that are most widely preferred by people in that society. Thus, when thinking

about the economic actions of groups of people, firms, and society, it is reasonable, as a first approximation, to

analyze them with the tools of economic analysis. For more on this, read about behavioral economics in the

chapter on Consumer Choices (http://openstax.org/books/principles-economics-3e/pages/6-introduction-to-

consumer-choices).

Second Objection: People, Firms, and Society Should Not Act This Way

The economics approach portrays people as self-interested. For some critics of this approach, even if self-

interest is an accurate description of how people behave, these behaviors are not moral. Instead, the critics

argue that people should be taught to care more deeply about others. Economists offer several answers to

these concerns.

First, economics is not a form of moral instruction. Rather, it seeks to describe economic behavior as it actually

exists. Philosophers draw a distinction between positive statements, which describe the world as it is, and

normative statements, which describe how the world should be. Positive statements are factual. They may be

40 2 • Choice in a World of Scarcity

true or false, but we can test them, at least in principle. Normative statements are subjective questions of

opinion. We cannot test them since we cannot prove opinions to be true or false. They just are opinions based

on one's values. For example, an economist could analyze a proposed subway system in a certain city. If the

expected benefits exceed the costs, he concludes that the project is worthy—an example of positive analysis.

Another economist argues for extended unemployment compensation during the COVID-19 pandemic

because a rich country like the United States should take care of its less fortunate citizens—an example of

normative analysis.

Even if the line between positive and normative statements is not always crystal clear, economic analysis does

try to remain rooted in the study of the actual people who inhabit the actual economy. Fortunately however, the

assumption that individuals are purely self-interested is a simplification about human nature. In fact, we need

to look no further than to Adam Smith, the very father of modern economics to find evidence of this. The

opening sentence of his book, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, puts it very clearly: “How selfish soever man

may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of

others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of

seeing it.” Clearly, individuals are both self-interested and altruistic.

Second, we can label self-interested behavior and profit-seeking with other names, such as personal choice
and freedom. The ability to make personal choices about buying, working, and saving is an important personal

freedom. Some people may choose high-pressure, high-paying jobs so that they can earn and spend

considerable amounts of money on themselves. Others may allocate large portions of their earnings to charity

or spend it on their friends and family. Others may devote themselves to a career that can require much time,

energy, and expertise but does not offer high financial rewards, like being an elementary school teacher or a

social worker. Still others may choose a job that does consume much of their time or provide a high level of

income, but still leaves time for family, friends, and contemplation. Some people may prefer to work for a large

company; others might want to start their own business. People’s freedom to make their own economic choices

has a moral value worth respecting.

CLEAR IT UP

Is a diagram by any other name the same?
When you study economics, you may feel buried under an avalanche of diagrams. Your goal should be to recognize

the common underlying logic and pattern of the diagrams, not to memorize each one.

This chapter uses only one basic diagram, although we present it with different sets of labels. The consumption

budget constraint and the production possibilities frontier for society, as a whole, are the same basic diagram.

Figure 2.6 shows an individual budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier for two goods, Good 1 and

Good 2. The tradeoff diagram always illustrates three basic themes: scarcity, tradeoffs, and economic efficiency.

The first theme is scarcity. It is not feasible to have unlimited amounts of both goods. Even if the budget constraint

or a PPF shifts, scarcity remains—just at a different level. The second theme is tradeoffs. As depicted in the budget

constraint or the production possibilities frontier, it is necessary to forgo some of one good to gain more of the other

good. The details of this tradeoff vary. In a budget constraint we determine, the tradeoff is determined by the

relative prices of the goods: that is, the relative price of two goods in the consumption choice budget constraint.

These tradeoffs appear as a straight line. However, a curved line represents the tradeoffs in many production

possibilities frontiers because the law of diminishing returns holds that as we add resources to an area, the marginal

gains tend to diminish. Regardless of the specific shape, tradeoffs remain.

The third theme is economic efficiency, or getting the most benefit from scarce resources. All choices on the

production possibilities frontier show productive efficiency because in such cases, there is no way to increase the

quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of the other. Similarly, when an individual makes a choice

along a budget constraint, there is no way to increase the quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of

the other. The choice on a production possibilities set that is socially preferred, or the choice on an individual’s

budget constraint that is personally preferred, will display allocative efficiency.

The basic budget constraint/production possibilities frontier diagram will recur throughout this book. Some

examples include using these tradeoff diagrams to analyze trade, environmental protection and economic output,

equality of incomes and economic output, and the macroeconomic tradeoff between consumption and investment.

Do not allow the different labels to confuse you. The budget constraint/production possibilities frontier diagram is

always just a tool for thinking carefully about scarcity, tradeoffs, and efficiency in a particular situation.

FIGURE 2.6 The Tradeoff Diagram Both the individual opportunity set (or budget constraint) and the social

production possibilities frontier show the constraints under which individual consumers and society as a whole

operate. Both diagrams show the tradeoff in choosing more of one good at the cost of less of the other.

Third, self-interested behavior can lead to positive social results. For example, when people work hard to make

a living, they create economic output. Consumers who are looking for the best deals will encourage businesses

to offer goods and services that meet their needs. Adam Smith, writing in The Wealth of Nations, named this

property the invisible hand. In describing how consumers and producers interact in a market economy, Smith

wrote:

Every individual…generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how

much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends

only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the
greatest value, he intends only his own gain. And he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an

invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention…By pursuing his own interest he

frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.

The metaphor of the invisible hand suggests the remarkable possibility that broader social good can emerge

from selfish individual actions.

Fourth, even people who focus on their own self-interest in the economic part of their life often set aside their

own narrow self-interest in other parts of life. For example, you might focus on your own self-interest when

asking your employer for a raise or negotiating to buy a car. Then you might turn around and focus on other

people when you volunteer to read stories at the local library, help a friend move to a new apartment, or donate

money to a charity. Self-interest is a reasonable starting point for analyzing many economic decisions, without

needing to imply that people never do anything that is not in their own immediate self-interest.

42 2 • Choice in a World of Scarcity

BRING IT HOME

Choices ... to What Degree?
What have we learned? We know that scarcity impacts all the choices we make. An economist might argue that

people do not obtain a bachelor’s or master’s degree because they do not have the resources to make those choices

or because their incomes are too low and/or the price of these degrees is too high. A bachelor’s or a master’s degree

may not be available in their opportunity set.

The price of these degrees may be too high not only because the actual price, college tuition (and perhaps room and

board), is too high. An economist might also say that for many people, the full opportunity cost of a bachelor’s or a

master’s degree is too high. For these people, they are unwilling or unable to make the tradeoff of forfeiting years of

working, and earning an income, to earn a degree.

Finally, the statistics we introduced at the start of the chapter reveal information about intertemporal choices. An

economist might say that people choose not to obtain a college degree because they may have to borrow money to

attend college, and the interest they have to pay on that loan in the future will affect their decisions today. Also, it

could be that some people have a preference for current consumption over future consumption, so they choose to

work now at a lower salary and consume now, rather than postponing that consumption until after they graduate

college.

Key Concepts and Summary

2.1 How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget Constraint

Economists see the real world as one of scarcity: that is, a world in which people’s desires exceed what is

possible. As a result, economic behavior involves tradeoffs in which individuals, firms, and society must forgo

something that they desire to obtain things that they desire more. Individuals face the tradeoff of what

quantities of goods and services to consume. The budget constraint, which is the frontier of the opportunity

set, illustrates the range of available choices. The relative price of the choices determines the slope of the

budget constraint. Choices beyond the budget constraint are not affordable.

Opportunity cost measures cost by what we forgo in exchange. Sometimes we can measure opportunity cost in

money, but it is often useful to consider time as well, or to measure it in terms of the actual resources that we

must forfeit.

Most economic decisions and tradeoffs are not all-or-nothing. Instead, they involve marginal analysis, which

means they are about decisions on the margin, involving a little more or a little less. The law of diminishing

marginal utility points out that as a person receives more of something—whether it is a specific good or

another resource—the additional marginal gains tend to become smaller. Because sunk costs occurred in the

past and cannot be recovered, they should be disregarded in making current decisions.

2.2 The Production Possibilities Frontier and Social Choices

A production possibilities frontier defines the set of choices society faces for the combinations of goods and

services it can produce given the resources and the technology that are available. The shape of the PPF is

typically curved outward, rather than straight. Choices outside the PPF are unattainable and choices inside the

44 2 • Self-Check Questions

PPF are wasteful. Over time, a growing economy will tend to shift the PPF outwards.

The law of diminishing returns holds that as increments of additional resources are devoted to producing

something, the marginal increase in output will become increasingly smaller. All choices along a production

possibilities frontier display productive efficiency; that is, it is impossible to use society’s resources to produce

more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. The specific choice along a production

possibilities frontier that reflects the mix of goods society prefers is the choice with allocative efficiency. The

curvature of the PPF is likely to differ by country, which results in different countries having comparative

advantage in different goods. Total production can increase if countries specialize in the goods in which they

have comparative advantage and trade some of their production for the remaining goods.

2.3 Confronting Objections to the Economic Approach

The economic way of thinking provides a useful approach to understanding human behavior. Economists

make the careful distinction between positive statements, which describe the world as it is, and normative

statements, which describe how the world should be. Even when economics analyzes the gains and losses from

various events or policies, and thus draws normative conclusions about how the world should be, the analysis

of economics is rooted in a positive analysis of how people, firms, and governments actually behave, not how

they should behave.

Why Can We Not Get Enough of Organic Foods?
Organic food is increasingly popular, not just in the United States, but worldwide. At one time, consumers had to go

to specialty stores or farmers' markets to find organic produce. Now it is available in most grocery stores. In short,

48 3 • Demand and Supply

organic has become part of the mainstream.

Ever wonder why organic food costs more than conventional food? Why, say, does an organic Fuji apple cost $2.75 a

pound, while its conventional counterpart costs $1.72 a pound? The same price relationship is true for just about

every organic product on the market. If many organic foods are locally grown, would they not take less time to get to

market and therefore be cheaper? What are the forces that keep those prices from coming down? Turns out those

forces have quite a bit to do with this chapter’s topic: demand and supply.

An auction bidder pays thousands of dollars for a dress Whitney Houston wore. A collector spends a small

fortune for a few drawings by John Lennon. People usually react to purchases like these in two ways: their jaw

drops because they think these are high prices to pay for such goods or they think these are rare, desirable

items and the amount paid seems right.

When economists talk about prices, they are less interested in making judgments than in gaining a practical

understanding of what determines prices and why prices change. Consider a price most of us contend with

weekly: that of a gallon of gas. Why was the average price of gasoline in the United States $3.16 per gallon in

June of 2020? Why did the price for gasoline fall sharply to $2.42 per gallon by January of 2021? To explain

these price movements, economists focus on the determinants of what gasoline buyers are willing to pay and

what gasoline sellers are willing to accept.

As it turns out, the price of gasoline in June of any given year is nearly always higher than the price in January

of that same year. Over recent decades, gasoline prices in midsummer have averaged about 10 cents per gallon

more than their midwinter low. The likely reason is that people drive more in the summer, and are also willing

to pay more for gas, but that does not explain how steeply gas prices fell. Other factors were at work during

those 18 months, such as increases in supply and decreases in the demand for crude oil.

This chapter introduces the economic model of demand and supply—one of the most powerful models in all of

economics. The discussion here begins by examining how demand and supply determine the price and the

quantity sold in markets for goods and services, and how changes in demand and supply lead to changes in

prices and quantities.

3.1 Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for Goods and Services

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain demand, quantity demanded, and the law of demand

• Explain supply, quantity supplied, and the law of supply

•

Identify a demand curve and a supply curve

• Explain equilibrium, equilibrium price, and equilibrium quantity

First let’s first focus on what economists mean by demand, what they mean by supply, and then how demand

and supply interact in a market.

Demand for Goods and Services

Economists use the term demand to refer to the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and

able to purchase at each price. Demand is fundamentally based on needs and wants—if you have no need or

want for something, you won't buy it. While a consumer may be able to differentiate between a need and a

want, from an economist’s perspective they are the same thing. Demand is also based on ability to pay. If you

3.1 • Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for Goods and Services 49

cannot pay for it, you have no effective demand. By this definition, a person who does not have a drivers

license has no effective demand for a car.

What a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called price. The total number of units that

consumers would purchase at that price is called the quantity demanded. A rise in price of a good or service

almost always decreases the quantity demanded of that good or service. Conversely, a fall in price will increase

the quantity demanded. When the price of a gallon of gasoline increases, for example, people look for ways to

reduce their consumption by combining several errands, commuting by carpool or mass transit, or taking

weekend or vacation trips closer to home. Economists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity

demanded the law of demand. The law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand (which

we explain in the next module) are held constant.

We can show an example from the market for gasoline in a table or a graph. Economist call a table that shows

the quantity demanded at each price, such as Table 3.1, a demand schedule. In this case we measure price in

dollars per gallon of gasoline. We measure the quantity demanded in millions of gallons over some time period

(for example, per day or per year) and over some geographic area (like a state or a country). A demand curve

shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded on a graph like Figure 3.2, with quantity on the
horizontal axis and the price per gallon on the vertical axis. (Note that this is an exception to the normal rule in
mathematics that the independent variable (x) goes on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable (y) goes

on the vertical axis. Economics is not math.)

Table 3.1 shows the demand schedule and the graph in Figure 3.2 shows the demand curve. These are two

ways to describe the same relationship between price and quantity demanded.

FIGURE 3.2 A Demand Curve for Gasoline The demand schedule shows that as price rises, quantity demanded

decreases, and vice versa. We graph these points, and the line connecting them is the demand curve (D). The

downward slope of the demand curve again illustrates the law of demand—the inverse relationship between prices

and quantity demanded.

Demand curves will appear somewhat different for each product. They may appear relatively steep or flat, or

they may be straight or curved. Nearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope

down from left to right. Demand curves embody the law of demand: As the price increases, the quantity

demanded decreases, and conversely, as the price decreases, the quantity demanded increases.

Confused about these different types of demand? Read the next Clear It Up feature.

CLEAR IT UP

Is demand the same as quantity demanded?
In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. When economists talk about demand,

they mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities demanded at those prices, as illustrated by

a demand curve or a demand schedule. When economists talk about quantity demanded, they mean only a certain

point on the demand curve, or one quantity on the demand schedule. In short, demand refers to the curve and

quantity demanded refers to a (specific) point on the curve.

Supply of Goods and Services

When economists talk about supply, they mean the amount of some good or service a producer is willing to

supply at each price. Price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. A rise in price

almost always leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of that good or service, while a fall in price will

decrease the quantity supplied. When the price of gasoline rises, for example, it encourages profit-seeking

firms to take several actions: expand exploration for oil reserves; drill for more oil; invest in more pipelines

and oil tankers to bring the oil to plants for refining into gasoline; build new oil refineries; purchase additional

pipelines and trucks to ship the gasoline to gas stations; and open more gas stations or keep existing gas

stations open longer hours. Economists call this positive relationship between price and quantity

supplied—that a higher price leads to a higher quantity supplied and a lower price leads to a lower quantity

supplied—the law of supply. The law of supply assumes that all other variables that affect supply (to be

explained in the next module) are held constant.

Is supply the same as quantity supplied?
In economic terminology, supply is not the same as quantity supplied. When economists refer to supply, they mean

the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities supplied at those prices, a relationship that we can

illustrate with a supply curve or a supply schedule. When economists refer to quantity supplied, they mean only a

certain point on the supply curve, or one quantity on the supply schedule. In short, supply refers to the curve and

quantity supplied refers to a (specific) point on the curve.

Figure 3.3 illustrates the law of supply, again using the market for gasoline as an example. Like demand, we

can illustrate supply using a table or a graph. A supply schedule is a table, like Table 3.2, that shows the

quantity supplied at a range of different prices. Again, we measure price in dollars per gallon of gasoline and

we measure quantity supplied in millions of gallons. A supply curve is a graphic illustration of the relationship

between price, shown on the vertical axis, and quantity, shown on the horizontal axis. The supply schedule and

the supply curve are just two different ways of showing the same information. Notice that the horizontal and

vertical axes on the graph for the supply curve are the same as for the demand curve.

FIGURE 3.3 A Supply Curve for Gasoline The supply schedule is the table that shows quantity supplied of gasoline

at each price. As price rises, quantity supplied also increases, and vice versa. The supply curve (S) is created by

graphing the points from the supply schedule and then connecting them. The upward slope of the supply curve

illustrates the law of supply—that a higher price leads to a higher quantity supplied, and vice versa.

TABLE 3.2 Price and Supply of Gasoline

The shape of supply curves will vary somewhat according to the product: steeper, flatter, straighter, or curved.

Nearly all supply curves, however, share a basic similarity: they slope up from left to right and illustrate the law

of supply: as the price rises, say, from $1.00 per gallon to $2.20 per gallon, the quantity supplied increases

from 500 gallons to 720 gallons. Conversely, as the price falls, the quantity supplied decreases.

Equilibrium—Where Demand and Supply Intersect

Because the graphs for demand and supply curves both have price on the vertical axis and quantity on the

horizontal axis, the demand curve and supply curve for a particular good or service can appear on the same
graph. Together, demand and supply determine the price and the quantity that will be bought and sold in a
market.

Figure 3.4 illustrates the interaction of demand and supply in the market for gasoline. The demand curve (D) is

identical to Figure 3.2. The supply curve (S) is identical to Figure 3.3. Table 3.3 contains the same information

in tabular form.

FIGURE 3.4 Demand and Supply for Gasoline The demand curve (D) and the supply curve (S) intersect at the

equilibrium point E, with a price of $1.40 and a quantity of 600. The equilibrium price is the only price where

quantity demanded is equal to quantity supplied. At a price above equilibrium like $1.80, quantity supplied exceeds

the quantity demanded, so there is excess supply. At a price below equilibrium such as $1.20, quantity demanded

exceeds quantity supplied, so there is excess demand.

TABLE 3.3 Price, Quantity Demanded, and Quantity Supplied

Remember this: When two lines on a diagram cross, this intersection usually means something. The point

where the supply curve (S) and the demand curve (D) cross, designated by point E in Figure 3.4, is called the

equilibrium. The equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers

agree—that is, where the amount of the product consumers want to buy (quantity demanded) is equal to the

amount producers want to sell (quantity supplied). Economists call this common quantity the equilibrium
quantity. At any other price, the quantity demanded does not equal the quantity supplied, so the market is not

in equilibrium at that price.

In Figure 3.4, the equilibrium price is $1.40 per gallon of gasoline and the equilibrium quantity is 600 million

gallons. If you had only the demand and supply schedules, and not the graph, you could find the equilibrium by

looking for the price level on the tables where the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied are equal.

The word “equilibrium” means “balance.” If a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no

reason to move away from that point. However, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise

to move the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.

Imagine, for example, that the price of a gallon of gasoline was above the equilibrium price—that is, instead of

$1.40 per gallon, the price is $1.80 per gallon. The dashed horizontal line at the price of $1.80 in Figure 3.4

illustrates this above-equilibrium price. At this higher price, the quantity demanded drops from 600 to 500.

This decline in quantity reflects how consumers react to the higher price by finding ways to use less gasoline.

Moreover, at this higher price of $1.80, the quantity of gasoline supplied rises from 600 to 680, as the higher

price makes it more profitable for gasoline producers to expand their output. Now, consider how quantity

demanded and quantity supplied are related at this above-equilibrium price. Quantity demanded has fallen to

500 gallons, while quantity supplied has risen to 680 gallons. In fact, at any above-equilibrium price, the

quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded. We call this an excess supply or a surplus.

With a surplus, gasoline accumulates at gas stations, in tanker trucks, in pipelines, and at oil refineries. This

accumulation puts pressure on gasoline sellers. If a surplus remains unsold, those firms involved in making

and selling gasoline are not receiving enough cash to pay their workers and to cover their expenses. In this

situation, some producers and sellers will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a lower price than not

to sell at all. Once some sellers start cutting prices, others will follow to avoid losing sales. These price

reductions in turn will stimulate a higher quantity demanded. Therefore, if the price is above the equilibrium

level, incentives built into the structure of demand and supply will create pressures for the price to fall toward

the equilibrium.

Now suppose that the price is below its equilibrium level at $1.20 per gallon, as the dashed horizontal line at

this price in Figure 3.4 shows. At this lower price, the quantity demanded increases from 600 to 700 as drivers

take longer trips, spend more minutes warming up the car in the driveway in wintertime, stop sharing rides to

work, and buy larger cars that get fewer miles to the gallon. However, the below-equilibrium price reduces

gasoline producers’ incentives to produce and sell gasoline, and the quantity supplied falls from 600 to 550.

54 3 • Demand and Supply

When the price is below equilibrium, there is excess demand, or a shortage—that is, at the given price the

quantity demanded, which has been stimulated by the lower price, now exceeds the quantity supplied, which

has been depressed by the lower price. In this situation, eager gasoline buyers mob the gas stations, only to

find many stations running short of fuel. Oil companies and gas stations recognize that they have an

opportunity to make higher profits by selling what gasoline they have at a higher price. As a result, the price

rises toward the equilibrium level. Read Demand, Supply, and Efficiency for more discussion on the

importance of the demand and supply model.

3.2 Shifts in Demand and Supply for Goods and Services

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•

Identify factors that affect demand

• Graph demand curves and demand shifts

•

Identify factors that affect supply

• Graph supply curves and supply shifts

The previous module explored how price affects the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied. The result

was the demand curve and the supply curve. Price, however, is not the only factor that influences buyers’ and

sellers’ decisions. For example, how is demand for vegetarian food affected if, say, health concerns cause more

consumers to avoid eating meat? How is the supply of diamonds affected if diamond producers discover

several new diamond mines? What are the major factors, in addition to the price, that influence demand or

supply?

What Factors Affect Demand?

We defined demand as the amount of some product a consumer is willing and able to purchase at each price.

That suggests at least two factors that affect demand. Willingness to purchase suggests a desire, based on what

economists call tastes and preferences. If you neither need nor want something, you will not buy it, and if you

really like something, you will buy more of it than someone who does not share your strong preference for it.

Ability to purchase suggests that income is important. Professors are usually able to afford better housing and

transportation than students, because they have more income. Prices of related goods can affect demand also.

If you need a new car, the price of a Honda may affect your demand for a Ford. Finally, the size or composition
of the population can affect demand. The more children a family has, the greater their demand for clothing.

The more driving-age children a family has, the greater their demand for car insurance, and the less for

diapers and baby formula.

These factors matter for both individual and market demand as a whole. Exactly how do these various factors

affect demand, and how do we show the effects graphically? To answer those questions, we need the ceteris

paribusassumption.

The Ceteris ParibusAssumption

A demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between two, and only two, variables: quantity on the

horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis. The assumption behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that

no relevant economic factors, other than the product’s price, are changing. Economists call this assumption

ceteris paribus, a Latin phrase meaning “other things being equal.” Any given demand or supply curve is

based on the ceteris paribusassumption that all else is held equal. A demand curve or a supply curve is a

relationship between two, and only two, variables when all other variables are kept constant. If all else is not

held equal, then the laws of supply and demand will not necessarily hold, as the following Clear It Up feature

3.2 • Shifts in Demand and Supply for Goods and Services 55

shows.

CLEAR IT UP

When does ceteris paribusapply?
We typically apply ceteris paribuswhen we observe how changes in price affect demand or supply, but we can apply

ceteris paribusmore generally. In the real world, demand and supply depend on more factors than just price. For

example, a consumer’s demand depends on income and a producer’s supply depends on the cost of producing the

product. How can we analyze the effect on demand or supply if multiple factors are changing at the same time—say

price rises and income falls? The answer is that we examine the changes one at a time, assuming the other factors

are held constant.

For example, we can say that an increase in the price reduces the amount consumers will buy (assuming income,

and anything else that affects demand, is unchanged). Additionally, a decrease in income reduces the amount

consumers can afford to buy (assuming price, and anything else that affects demand, is unchanged). This is what the

ceteris paribusassumption really means. In this particular case, after we analyze each factor separately, we can

combine the results. The amount consumers buy falls for two reasons: first because of the higher price and second

because of the lower income.

How Does Income Affect Demand?

Let’s use income as an example of how factors other than price affect demand. Figure 3.5 shows the initial
demand for automobiles as D0. At point Q, for example, if the price is $20,000 per car, the quantity of cars
demanded is 18 million. D0 also shows how the quantity of cars demanded would change as a result of a higher
or lower price. For example, if the price of a car rose to $22,000, the quantity demanded would decrease to 17

million, at point R.

The original demand curve D0, like every demand curve, is based on the ceteris paribusassumption that no
other economically relevant factors change. Now imagine that the economy expands in a way that raises the

incomes of many people, making cars more affordable. How will this affect demand? How can we show this

graphically?

Return to Figure 3.5. The price of cars is still $20,000, but with higher incomes, the quantity demanded has

now increased to 20 million cars, shown at point S. As a result of the higher income levels, the demand curve
shifts to the right to the new demand curve D1, indicating an increase in demand. Table 3.4 shows clearly that
this increased demand would occur at every price, not just the original one.

56 3 • Demand and Supply

FIGURE 3.5 Shifts in Demand: A Car Example Increased demand means that at every given price, the quantity
demanded is higher, so that the demand curve shifts to the right from D0 to D1. Decreased demand means that at
every given price, the quantity demanded is lower, so that the demand curve shifts to the left from D0 to D2.

Now, imagine that the economy slows down so that many people lose their jobs or work fewer hours, reducing
their incomes. In this case, the decrease in income would lead to a lower quantity of cars demanded at every
given price, and the original demand curve D0 would shift left to D2. The shift from D0 to D2 represents such a
decrease in demand: At any given price level, the quantity demanded is now lower. In this example, a price of

$20,000 means 18 million cars sold along the original demand curve, but only 14.4 million sold after demand

fell.

When a demand curve shifts, it does not mean that the quantity demanded by every individual buyer changes

by the same amount. In this example, not everyone would have higher or lower income and not everyone

would buy or not buy an additional car. Instead, a shift in a demand curve captures a pattern for the market as

a whole.

In the previous section, we argued that higher income causes greater demand at every price. This is true for

most goods and services. For some—luxury cars, vacations in Europe, and fine jewelry—the effect of a rise in

income can be especially pronounced. A product whose demand rises when income rises, and vice versa, is

called a normal good. A few exceptions to this pattern do exist. As incomes rise, many people will buy fewer

3.2 • Shifts in Demand and Supply for Goods and Services 57

generic brand groceries and more name brand groceries. They are less likely to buy used cars and more likely

to buy new cars. They will be less likely to rent an apartment and more likely to own a home. A product whose

demand falls when income rises, and vice versa, is called an inferior good. In other words, when income

increases, the demand curve shifts to the left.

Other Factors That Shift Demand Curves

Income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand. Other factors that change demand include tastes

and preferences, the composition or size of the population, the prices of related goods, and even expectations.

A change in any one of the underlying factors that determine what quantity people are willing to buy at a given

price will cause a shift in demand. Graphically, the new demand curve lies either to the right (an increase) or to

the left (a decrease) of the original demand curve. Let’s look at these factors.

Changing Tastes or Preferences

From 1980 to 2021, the per-person consumption of chicken by Americans rose from 47 pounds per year to 97

pounds per year, and consumption of beef fell from 76 pounds per year to 59 pounds per year, according to the

U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Changes like these are largely due to movements in taste, which

change the quantity of a good demanded at every price: that is, they shift the demand curve for that good,
rightward for chicken and leftward for beef.

Changes in the Composition of the Population

The proportion of elderly citizens in the United States population is rising. It rose from 9.8% in 1970 to 12.6%

in 2000, and will be a projected (by the U.S. Census Bureau) 20% of the population by 2030. A society with

relatively more children, like the United States in the 1960s, will have greater demand for goods and services

like tricycles and day care facilities. A society with relatively more elderly persons, as the United States is

projected to have by 2030, has a higher demand for nursing homes and hearing aids. Similarly, changes in the

size of the population can affect the demand for housing and many other goods. Each of these changes in

demand will be shown as a shift in the demand curve.

Changes in the Prices of Related Goods

Changes in the prices of related goods such as substitutes or complements also can affect the demand for a

product. A substitute is a good or service that we can use in place of another good or service. As electronic

books, like this one, become more available, you would expect to see a decrease in demand for traditional

printed books. A lower price for a substitute decreases demand for the other product. For example, in recent

years as the price of tablet computers has fallen, the quantity demanded has increased (because of the law of

demand). Since people are purchasing tablets, there has been a decrease in demand for laptops, which we can

show graphically as a leftward shift in the demand curve for laptops. A higher price for a substitute good has

the reverse effect.

Other goods are complements for each other, meaning we often use the goods together, because consumption

of one good tends to enhance consumption of the other. Examples include breakfast cereal and milk;

notebooks and pens or pencils, golf balls and golf clubs; gasoline and sport utility vehicles; and the five-way

combination of bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, and bread. If the price of golf clubs rises, since the

quantity demanded of golf clubs falls (because of the law of demand), demand for a complement good like golf

balls decreases, too. Similarly, a higher price for skis would shift the demand curve for a complement good like

ski resort trips to the left, while a lower price for a complement has the reverse effect.

Changes in Expectations about Future Prices or Other Factors that Affect Demand

While it is clear that the price of a good affects the quantity demanded, it is also true that expectations about

the future price (or expectations about tastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand. For

example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the store to buy flashlight batteries and

bottled water. If people learn that the price of a good like coffee is likely to rise in the future, they may head for

58 3 • Demand and Supply

the store to stock up on coffee now. We show these changes in demand as shifts in the curve. Therefore, a shift

in demand happens when a change in some economic factor (other than price) causes a different quantity to

be demanded at every price. The following Work It Out feature shows how this happens.

WORK IT OUT

Shift in Demand
A shift in demand means that at any price (and at every price), the quantity demanded will be different than it

was before. Following is an example of a shift in demand due to an income increase.

Step 1. Draw the graph of a demand curve for a normal good like pizza. Pick a price (like P0). Identify the
corresponding Q0. See an example in Figure 3.6.

FIGURE 3.6 Demand Curve We can use the demand curve to identify how much consumers would buy at any

given price.

Step 2. Suppose income increases. As a result of the change, are consumers going to buy more or less pizza? The

answer is more. Draw a dotted horizontal line from the chosen price, through the original quantity demanded, to
the new point with the new Q1. Draw a dotted vertical line down to the horizontal axis and label the new Q1.
Figure 3.7 provides an example.

FIGURE 3.7 Demand Curve with Income Increase With an increase in income, consumers will purchase larger

quantities, pushing demand to the right.

Step 3. Now, shift the curve through the new point. You will see that an increase in income causes an upward (or

rightward) shift in the demand curve, so that at any price the quantities demanded will be higher, as Figure 3.8

illustrates.

FIGURE 3.8 Demand Curve Shifted Right With an increase in income, consumers will purchase larger quantities,

pushing demand to the right, and causing the demand curve to shift right.

Summing Up Factors That Change Demand

Figure 3.9 summarizes six factors that can shift demand curves. The direction of the arrows indicates whether

the demand curve shifts represent an increase in demand or a decrease in demand. Notice that a change in the

price of the good or service itself is not listed among the factors that can shift a demand curve. A change in the

price of a good or service causes a movement along a specific demand curve, and it typically leads to some

change in the quantity demanded, but it does not shift the demand curve.

FIGURE 3.9 Factors That Shift Demand Curves (a) A list of factors that can cause an increase in demand from D0 to
D1. (b) The same factors, if their direction is reversed, can cause a decrease in demand from D0 to D1.

When a demand curve shifts, it will then intersect with a given supply curve at a different equilibrium price

and quantity. We are, however, getting ahead of our story. Before discussing how changes in demand can affect

equilibrium price and quantity, we first need to discuss shifts in supply curves.

How Production Costs Affect Supply

A supply curve shows how quantity supplied will change as the price rises and falls, assuming ceteris paribus

so that no other economically relevant factors are changing. If other factors relevant to supply do change, then

the entire supply curve will shift. Just as we described a shift in demand as a change in the quantity demanded

at every price, a shift in supply means a change in the quantity supplied at every price.

In thinking about the factors that affect supply, remember what motivates firms: profits, which are the

difference between revenues and costs. A firm produces goods and services using combinations of labor,

materials, and machinery, or what we call inputs or factors of production. If a firm faces lower costs of

production, while the prices for the good or service the firm produces remain unchanged, a firm’s profits go

60 3 • Demand and Supply

up. When a firm’s profits increase, it is more motivated to produce output, since the more it produces the more

profit it will earn. When costs of production fall, a firm will tend to supply a larger quantity at any given price

for its output. We can show this by the supply curve shifting to the right.

Take, for example, a messenger company that delivers packages around a city. The company may find that

buying gasoline is one of its main costs. If the price of gasoline falls, then the company will find it can deliver

messages more cheaply than before. Since lower costs correspond to higher profits, the messenger company

may now supply more of its services at any given price. For example, given the lower gasoline prices, the

company can now serve a greater area, and increase its supply.

Conversely, if a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any given selling price for

its products. As a result, a higher cost of production typically causes a firm to supply a smaller quantity at any

given price. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the left.

Consider the supply for cars, shown by curve S0 in Figure 3.10. Point J indicates that if the price is $20,000, the
quantity supplied will be 18 million cars. If the price rises to $22,000 per car, ceteris paribus,the quantity
supplied will rise to 20 million cars, as point K on the S0 curve shows. We can show the same information in
table form, as in Table 3.5.

FIGURE 3.10 Shifts in Supply: A Car Example Decreased supply means that at every given price, the quantity
supplied is lower, so that the supply curve shifts to the left, from S0 to S1. Increased supply means that at every
given price, the quantity supplied is higher, so that the supply curve shifts to the right, from S0 to S2.

3.2 • Shifts in Demand and Supply for Goods and Services 61

Now, imagine that the price of steel, an important ingredient in manufacturing cars, rises, so that producing a

car has become more expensive. At any given price for selling cars, car manufacturers will react by supplying a
lower quantity. We can show this graphically as a leftward shift of supply, from S0 to S1, which indicates that at
any given price, the quantity supplied decreases. In this example, at a price of $20,000, the quantity supplied
decreases from 18 million on the original supply curve (S0) to 16.5 million on the supply curve S1, which is
labeled as point L.

Conversely, if the price of steel decreases, producing a car becomes less expensive. At any given price for

selling cars, car manufacturers can now expect to earn higher profits, so they will supply a higher quantity. The
shift of supply to the right, from S0 to S2, means that at all prices, the quantity supplied has increased. In this
example, at a price of $20,000, the quantity supplied increases from 18 million on the original supply curve
(S0) to 19.8 million on the supply curve S2, which is labeled M.

Other Factors That Affect Supply

In the example above, we saw that changes in the prices of inputs in the production process will affect the cost

of production and thus the supply. Several other things affect the cost of production, too, such as changes in

weather or other natural conditions, new technologies for production, and some government policies.

Changes in weather and climate will affect the cost of production for many agricultural products. For example,

in 2014 the Manchurian Plain in Northeastern China, which produces most of the country's wheat, corn, and

soybeans, experienced its most severe drought in 50 years. A drought decreases the supply of agricultural

products, which means that at any given price, a lower quantity will be supplied. Conversely, especially good

weather would shift the supply curve to the right.

When a firm discovers a new technology that allows the firm to produce at a lower cost, the supply curve will

shift to the right, as well. For instance, in the 1960s a major scientific effort nicknamed the Green Revolution

focused on breeding improved seeds for basic crops like wheat and rice. By the early 1990s, more than two-

thirds of the wheat and rice in low-income countries around the world used these Green Revolution seeds—and

the harvest was twice as high per acre. A technological improvement that reduces costs of production will shift

supply to the right, so that a greater quantity will be produced at any given price.

Government policies can affect the cost of production and the supply curve through taxes, regulations, and

subsidies. For example, the U.S. government imposes a tax on alcoholic beverages that collects about $8 billion

per year from producers. Businesses treat taxes as costs. Higher costs decrease supply for the reasons we

discussed above. Other examples of policy that can affect cost are the wide array of government regulations

that require firms to spend money to provide a cleaner environment or a safer workplace. Complying with

regulations increases costs.

A government subsidy, on the other hand, is the opposite of a tax. A subsidy occurs when the government pays

a firm directly or reduces the firm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. From the firm’s perspective,

taxes or regulations are an additional cost of production that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to

produce a lower quantity at every given price. Government subsidies reduce the cost of production and

increase supply at every given price, shifting supply to the right. The following Work It Out feature shows how

this shift happens.

WORK IT OUT

Shift in Supply
We know that a supply curve shows the minimum price a firm will accept to produce a given quantity of output.

What happens to the supply curve when the cost of production goes up? Following is an example of a shift in

supply due to a production cost increase. (We’ll introduce some other concepts regarding firm decision-making in

62 3 • Demand and Supply

Chapters 7 and 8.)

Step 1. Draw a graph of a supply curve for pizza. Pick a quantity (like Q0). If you draw a vertical line up from Q0 to
the supply curve, you will see the price the firm chooses. Figure 3.11 provides an example.

FIGURE 3.11 Supply Curve You can use a supply curve to show the minimum price a firm will accept to produce

a given quantity of output.

Step 2. Why did the firm choose that price and not some other? One way to think about this is that the price is

composed of two parts. The first part is the cost of producing pizzas at the margin; in this case, the cost of

producing the pizza, including cost of ingredients (e.g., dough, sauce, cheese, and pepperoni), the cost of the

pizza oven, the shop rent, and the workers' wages. The second part is the firm’s desired profit, which is

determined, among other factors, by the profit margins in that particular business. (Desired profit is not

necessarily the same as economic profit, which will be explained in Chapter 7.) If you add these two parts

together, you get the price the firm wishes to charge. The quantity Q0 and associated price P0 give you one point

on the firm’s supply curve, as Figure 3.12 illustrates.

FIGURE 3.12 Setting Prices The cost of production and the desired profit equal the price a firm will set for a

product.

Step 3. Now, suppose that the cost of production increases. Perhaps cheese has become more expensive by

$0.75 per pizza. If that is true, the firm will want to raise its price by the amount of the increase in cost ($0.75).

Draw this point on the supply curve directly above the initial point on the curve, but $0.75 higher, as Figure 3.13

shows.

3.2 • Shifts in Demand and Supply for Goods and Services 63

FIGURE 3.13 Increasing Costs Leads to Increasing Price Because the cost of production and the desired profit

equal the price a firm will set for a product, if the cost of production increases, the price for the product will also

need to increase.

Step 4. Shift the supply curve through this point. You will see that an increase in cost causes an upward (or a

leftward) shift of the supply curve so that at any price, the quantities supplied will be smaller, as Figure 3.14

illustrates.

FIGURE 3.14 Supply Curve Shifts When the cost of production increases, the supply curve shifts upwardly to a

new price level.

Summing Up Factors That Change Supply

Changes in the cost of inputs, natural disasters, new technologies, and the impact of government decisions all
affect the cost of production. In turn, these factors affect how much firms are willing to supply at any given

price.

Figure 3.15 summarizes factors that change the supply of goods and services. Notice that a change in the price

of the product itself is not among the factors that shift the supply curve. Although a change in price of a good or

service typically causes a change in quantity supplied or a movement along the supply curve for that specific

good or service, it does not cause the supply curve itself to shift.

64 3 • Demand and Supply

FIGURE 3.15 Factors That Shift Supply Curves (a) A list of factors that can cause an increase in supply from S0 to
S1. (b) The same factors, if their direction is reversed, can cause a decrease in supply from S0 to S1.

Because demand and supply curves appear on a two-dimensional diagram with only price and quantity on the

axes, an unwary visitor to the land of economics might be fooled into believing that economics is about only

four topics: demand, supply, price, and quantity. However, demand and supply are really “umbrella” concepts:

demand covers all the factors that affect demand, and supply covers all the factors that affect supply. We

include factors other than price that affect demand and supply by using shifts in the demand or the supply

curve. In this way, the two-dimensional demand and supply model becomes a powerful tool for analyzing a

wide range of economic circumstances.

3.3 Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity: The Four-Step Process

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•

Identify equilibrium price and quantity through the four-step process

• Graph equilibrium price and quantity

• Contrast shifts of demand or supply and movements along a demand or supply curve

• Graph demand and supply curves, including equilibrium price and quantity, based on real-world

examples

Let’s begin this discussion with a single economic event. It might be an event that affects demand, like a

change in income, population, tastes, prices of substitutes or complements, or expectations about future

prices. It might be an event that affects supply, like a change in natural conditions, input prices, or technology,

or government policies that affect production. How does this economic event affect equilibrium price and

quantity? We will analyze this question using a four-step process.

Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model before the economic change took place. To establish the model

requires four standard pieces of information: The law of demand, which tells us the slope of the demand curve

is negative; the law of supply, which tells us that the slope of the supply curve is positive; the shift variables for

demand; and the shift variables for supply. From this model, find the initial equilibrium values for price and

quantity.

Step 2. Decide whether the economic change you are analyzing affects demand or supply. In other words, does

the event refer to something in the list of demand factors or supply factors?

Step 3. Decide whether the effect on demand or supply causes the curve to shift to the right or to the left, and

sketch the new demand or supply curve on the diagram. In other words, does the event increase or decrease

the amount consumers want to buy or producers want to sell?

Step 4. Identify the new equilibrium and then compare the original equilibrium price and quantity to the new

equilibrium price and quantity.

3.3 • Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity: The Four-Step Process 65

Let’s consider one example that involves a shift in supply and one that involves a shift in demand. Then we will

consider an example where both supply and demand shift.

Good Weather for Salmon Fishing

Suppose that during the summer of 2015, weather conditions were excellent for commercial salmon fishing off

the California coast. Heavy rains meant higher than normal levels of water in the rivers, which helps the

salmon to breed. Slightly cooler ocean temperatures stimulated the growth of plankton, the microscopic

organisms at the bottom of the ocean food chain, providing everything in the ocean with a hearty food supply.

The ocean stayed calm during fishing season, so commercial fishing operations did not lose many days to bad

weather. How did these climate conditions affect the quantity and price of salmon? Figure 3.16 illustrates the

four-step approach, which we explain below, to work through this problem. Table 3.6 also provides the

information to work the problem.

FIGURE 3.16 Good Weather for Salmon Fishing: The Four-Step Process Unusually good weather leads to changes

in the price and quantity of salmon.

Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate the market for salmon in the year before the good
weather conditions began. The demand curve D0 and the supply curve S0 show that the original equilibrium

66 3 • Demand and Supply

price is $3.25 per pound and the original equilibrium quantity is 250,000 fish. (This price per pound is what

commercial buyers pay at the fishing docks. What consumers pay at the grocery is higher.)

Step 2. Did the economic event affect supply or demand? Good weather is an example of a natural condition

that affects supply.

Step 3. Was the effect on supply an increase or a decrease? Good weather is a change in natural conditions that

increases the quantity supplied at any given price. The supply curve shifts to the right, moving from the
original supply curve S0 to the new supply curve S1, which Figure 3.16 and Table 3.6 show.

Step 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium. At the new equilibrium E1,
the equilibrium price falls from $3.25 to $2.50, but the equilibrium quantity increases from 250,000 to

550,000 salmon. Notice that the equilibrium quantity demanded increased, even though the demand curve

did not move.

In short, good weather conditions increased supply of the California commercial salmon. The result was a

higher equilibrium quantity of salmon bought and sold in the market at a lower price.

Newspapers and the Internet

According to the Pew Research Center for People and the Press, increasingly more people, especially younger

people, are obtaining their news from online and digital sources. The majority of U.S. adults now own

smartphones or tablets, and most of those Americans say they use them in part to access the news. From 2004

to 2012, the share of Americans who reported obtaining their news from digital sources increased from 24% to

39%. How has this affected consumption of print news media, and radio and television news? Figure 3.17 and

the text below illustrates using the four-step analysis to answer this question.

FIGURE 3.17 The Print News Market: A Four-Step Analysis A change in tastes from print news sources to digital

sources results in a leftward shift in demand for the former. The result is a decrease in both equilibrium price and

quantity.

Step 1. Develop a demand and supply model to think about what the market looked like before the event. The
demand curve D0 and the supply curve S0 show the original relationships. In this case, we perform the analysis
without specific numbers on the price and quantity axis.

Step 2. Did the described change affect supply or demand? A change in tastes, from traditional news sources

(print, radio, and television) to digital sources, caused a change in demand for the former.

Step 3. Was the effect on demand positive or negative? A shift to digital news sources will tend to mean a lower

3.3 • Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity: The Four-Step Process 67

quantity demanded of traditional news sources at every given price, causing the demand curve for print and
other traditional news sources to shift to the left, from D0 to D1.

Step 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium
(E1) occurs at a lower quantity and a lower price than the original equilibrium (E0).

The decline in print news reading predates 2004. Print newspaper circulation peaked in 1973 and has

declined since then due to competition from television and radio news. In 1991, 55% of Americans indicated

they received their news from print sources, while only 29% did so in 2012. Radio news has followed a similar

path in recent decades, with the share of Americans obtaining their news from radio declining from 54% in

1991 to 33% in 2012. Television news has held its own in recent years, with a market share staying in the mid

to upper fifties. What does this suggest for the future, given that two-thirds of Americans under 30 years old

say they do not obtain their news from television at all?

The Interconnections and Speed of Adjustment in Real Markets

In the real world, many factors that affect demand and supply can change all at once. For example, the demand

for cars might increase because of rising incomes and population, and it might decrease because of rising

gasoline prices (a complementary good). Likewise, the supply of cars might increase because of innovative new
technologies that reduce the cost of car production, and it might decrease as a result of new government

regulations requiring the installation of costly pollution-control technology.

Moreover, rising incomes and population or changes in gasoline prices will affect many markets, not just cars.

How can an economist sort out all these interconnected events? The answer lies in the ceteris paribus

assumption. Look at how each economic event affects each market, one event at a time, holding all else

constant. Then combine the analyses to see the net effect.

A Combined Example

The U.S. Postal Service is facing difficult challenges. Compensation for postal workers tends to increase most

years due to cost-of-living increases. At the same time, increasingly more people are using email, text, and

other digital message forms such as Facebook and Twitter to communicate with friends and others. What does

this suggest about the continued viability of the Postal Service? Figure 3.18 and the text below illustrate this

using the four-step analysis to answer this question.

FIGURE 3.18 Higher Compensation for Postal Workers: A Four-Step Analysis (a) Higher labor compensation causes

68 3 • Demand and Supply

a leftward shift in the supply curve, a decrease in the equilibrium quantity, and an increase in the equilibrium price.

(b) A change in tastes away from Postal Services causes a leftward shift in the demand curve, a decrease in the

equilibrium quantity, and a decrease in the equilibrium price.

Since this problem involves two disturbances, we need two four-step analyses, the first to analyze the effects of

higher compensation for postal workers, the second to analyze the effects of many people switching from

“snail mail” to email and other digital messages.

Figure 3.18 (a) shows the shift in supply discussed in the following steps.

Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate what the market for the U.S. Postal Service looked like
before this scenario starts. The demand curve D0 and the supply curve S0 show the original relationships.

Step 2. Did the described change affect supply or demand? Labor compensation is a cost of production. A

change in production costs caused a change in supply for the Postal Service.

Step 3. Was the effect on supply positive or negative? Higher labor compensation leads to a lower quantity

supplied of postal services at every given price, causing the supply curve for postal services to shift to the left,
from S0 to S1.

Step 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium
(E1) occurs at a lower quantity and a higher price than the original equilibrium (E0).

Figure 3.18 (b) shows the shift in demand in the following steps.

Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate what the market for U.S. Postal Services looked like
before this scenario starts. The demand curve D0 and the supply curve S0 show the original relationships. Note
that this diagram is independent from the diagram in panel (a).

Step 2. Did the change described affect supply or demand? A change in tastes away from snail mail toward

digital messages will cause a change in demand for the Postal Service.

Step 3. Was the effect on demand positive or negative? A change in tastes away from snailmail toward digital

messages causes lower quantity demanded of postal services at every given price, causing the demand curve
for postal services to shift to the left, from D0 to D1.

Step 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium
(E2) occurs at a lower quantity and a lower price than the original equilibrium (E0).

The final step in a scenario where both supply and demand shift is to combine the two individual analyses to

determine what happens to the equilibrium quantity and price. Graphically, we superimpose the previous two

diagrams one on top of the other, as in Figure 3.19.

3.3 • Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity: The Four-Step Process 69

FIGURE 3.19 Combined Effect of Decreased Demand and Decreased Supply Supply and demand shifts cause

changes in equilibrium price and quantity.

Following are the results:

Effect on Quantity: The effect of higher labor compensation on Postal Services because it raises the cost of

production is to decrease the equilibrium quantity. The effect of a change in tastes away from snail mail is to

decrease the equilibrium quantity. Since both shifts are to the left, the overall impact is a decrease in the
equilibrium quantity of Postal Services (Q3). This is easy to see graphically, since Q3 is to the left of Q0.

Effect on Price: The overall effect on price is more complicated. The effect of higher labor compensation on

Postal Services, because it raises the cost of production, is to increase the equilibrium price. The effect of a

change in tastes away from snail mail is to decrease the equilibrium price. Since the two effects are in opposite

directions, unless we know the magnitudes of the two effects, the overall effect is unclear. This is not unusual.

When both curves shift, typically we can determine the overall effect on price or on quantity, but not on both.

In this case, we determined the overall effect on the equilibrium quantity, but not on the equilibrium price. In

other cases, it might be the opposite.

The next Clear It Up feature focuses on the difference between shifts of supply or demand and movements

along a curve.

CLEAR IT UP

What is the difference between shifts of demand or supply versus movements along a demand or
supply curve?
One common mistake in applying the demand and supply framework is to confuse the shift of a demand or a supply

curve with movement along a demand or supply curve. As an example, consider a problem that asks whether a

drought will increase or decrease the equilibrium quantity and equilibrium price of wheat. Lee, a student in an

introductory economics class, might reason:

“Well, it is clear that a drought reduces supply, so I will shift back the supply curve, as in the shift from the original
supply curve S0 to S1 on the diagram (Shift 1). The equilibrium moves from E0 to E1, the equilibrium quantity is lower
and the equilibrium price is higher. Then, a higher price makes farmers more likely to supply the good, so the supply
curve shifts right, as shows the shift from S1 to S2, shows on the diagram (Shift 2), so that the equilibrium now
moves from E1 to E2. The higher price, however, also reduces demand and so causes demand to shift back, like the

70 3 • Demand and Supply

shift from the original demand curve, D0 to D1 on the diagram (labeled Shift 3), and the equilibrium moves from E2 to
E3.”

FIGURE 3.20 Shifts of Demand or Supply versus Movements along a Demand or Supply Curve A shift in one curve

never causes a shift in the other curve. Rather, a shift in one curve causes a movement along the second curve.

At about this point, Lee suspects that this answer is headed down the wrong path. Think about what might be wrong

with Lee’s logic, and then read the answer that follows.

Answer:Lee’s first step is correct: that is, a drought shifts back the supply curve of wheat and leads to a prediction

of a lower equilibrium quantity and a higher equilibrium price. This corresponds to a movement along the original
demand curve (D0), from E0 to E1. The rest of Lee’s argument is wrong, because it mixes up shifts in supply with
quantity supplied, and shifts in demand with quantity demanded. A higher or lower price never shifts the supply
curve, as suggested by the shift in supply from S1 to S2. Instead, a price change leads to a movement along a given
supply curve. Similarly, a higher or lower price never shifts a demand curve, as suggested in the shift from D0 to D1.
Instead, a price change leads to a movement along a given demand curve. Remember, a change in the price of a

good never causes the demand or supply curve for that good to shift.

Think carefully about the timeline of events: What happens first, what happens next? What is cause, what is effect?

If you keep the order right, you are more likely to get the analysis correct.

In the four-step analysis of how economic events affect equilibrium price and quantity, the movement from the

old to the new equilibrium seems immediate. As a practical matter, however, prices and quantities often do not

zoom straight to equilibrium. More realistically, when an economic event causes demand or supply to shift,

prices and quantities set off in the general direction of equilibrium. Even as they are moving toward one new

equilibrium, a subsequent change in demand or supply often pushes prices toward another equilibrium.

3.4 Price Ceilings and Price Floors

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain price controls, price ceilings, and price floors

• Analyze demand and supply as a social adjustment mechanism

To this point in the chapter, we have been assuming that markets are free, that is, they operate with no

government intervention. In this section, we will explore the outcomes, both anticipated and otherwise, when

government does intervene in a market either to prevent the price of some good or service from rising “too

high” or to prevent the price of some good or service from falling “too low”.

Economists believe there are a small number of fundamental principles that explain how economic agents

Access for free at openstax.org

3.4 • Price Ceilings and Price Floors 71

respond in different situations. Two of these principles, which we have already introduced, are the laws of

demand and supply.

Governments can pass laws affecting market outcomes, but no law can negate these economic principles.

Rather, the principles will become apparent in sometimes unexpected ways, which may undermine the intent

of the government policy. This is one of the major conclusions of this section.

Controversy sometimes surrounds the prices and quantities established by demand and supply, especially for

products that are considered necessities. In some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on

politicians, who may then pass legislation to prevent a certain price from climbing “too high” or falling “too

low.”

The demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the incentives that these laws provide

to control prices, in ways that will often lead to undesirable consequences. Alternative policy tools can often

achieve the desired goals of price control laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs.

Price Ceilings

Laws that governments enact to regulate prices are called price controls. Price controls come in two flavors. A

price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level (the “ceiling”), while a price floor keeps a price

from falling below a given level (the “floor”). This section uses the demand and supply framework to analyze

price ceilings. The next section discusses price floors.

A price ceiling is a legal maximum price that one pays for some good or service. A government imposes price

ceilings in order to keep the price of some necessary good or service affordable. For example, in 2005 during

Hurricane Katrina, the price of bottled water increased above $5 per gallon. As a result, many people called for

price controls on bottled water to prevent the price from rising so high. In this particular case, the government

did not impose a price ceiling, but there are other examples of where price ceilings did occur.

In many markets for goods and services, demanders outnumber suppliers. Consumers, who are also potential

voters, sometimes unite behind a political proposal to hold down a certain price. In some cities, such as

Albany, renters have pressed political leaders to pass rent control laws, a price ceiling that usually works by

stating that landlords can raise rents by only a certain maximum percentage each year. Some of the best

examples of rent control occur in urban areas such as New York, Washington D.C., or San Francisco.

Rent control becomes a politically hot topic when rents begin to rise rapidly. Everyone needs an affordable

place to live. Perhaps a change in tastes makes a certain suburb or town a more popular place to live. Perhaps

locally-based businesses expand, bringing higher incomes and more people into the area. Such changes can
cause a change in the demand for rental housing, as Figure 3.21 illustrates. The original equilibrium (E0) lies at
the intersection of supply curve S0 and demand curve D0, corresponding to an equilibrium price of $500 and
an equilibrium quantity of 15,000 units of rental housing. The effect of greater income or a change in tastes is
to shift the demand curve for rental housing to the right, as the data in Table 3.7 shows and the shift from D0 to
D1 on the graph. In this market, at the new equilibrium E1, the price of a rental unit would rise to $600 and the
equilibrium quantity would increase to 17,000 units.

72 3 • Demand and Supply

FIGURE 3.21 A Price Ceiling Example—Rent Control The original intersection of demand and supply occurs at E0. If
demand shifts from D0 to D1, the new equilibrium would be at E1—unless a price ceiling prevents the price from
rising. If the price is not permitted to rise, the quantity supplied remains at 15,000. However, after the change in

demand, the quantity demanded rises to 19,000, resulting in a shortage.

Suppose that a city government passes a rent control law to keep the price at the original equilibrium of $500

for a typical apartment. In Figure 3.21, the horizontal line at the price of $500 shows the legally fixed

maximum price set by the rent control law. However, the underlying forces that shifted the demand curve to

the right are still there. At that price ($500), the quantity supplied remains at the same 15,000 rental units, but

the quantity demanded is 19,000 rental units. In other words, the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity

supplied, so there is a shortage of rental housing. One of the ironies of price ceilings is that while the price

ceiling was intended to help renters, there are actually fewer apartments rented out under the price ceiling

(15,000 rental units) than would be the case at the market rent of $600 (17,000 rental units).

Price ceilings do not simply benefit renters at the expense of landlords. Rather, some renters (or potential

renters) lose their housing as landlords convert apartments to co-ops and condos. Even when the housing

remains in the rental market, landlords tend to spend less on maintenance and on essentials like heating,

cooling, hot water, and lighting. The first rule of economics is you do not get something for nothing—everything

has an opportunity cost. Thus, if renters obtain “cheaper” housing than the market requires, they tend to also

end up with lower quality housing.

Price ceilings are enacted in an attempt to keep prices low for those who need the product. However, when the

market price is not allowed to rise to the equilibrium level, quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied, and

thus a shortage occurs. Those who manage to purchase the product at the lower price given by the price ceiling

will benefit, but sellers of the product will suffer, along with those who are not able to purchase the product at

all. Quality is also likely to deteriorate.

3.4 • Price Ceilings and Price Floors 73

Price Floors

A price floor is the lowest price that one can legally pay for some good or service. Perhaps the best-known

example of a price floor is the minimum wage, which is based on the view that someone working full time

should be able to afford a basic standard of living. The federal minimum wage in 2022 was $7.25 per hour,

although some states and localities have a higher minimum wage. The federal minimum wage yields an annual

income for a single person of $15,080, which is slightly higher than the Federal poverty line of $11,880.

Congress periodically raises the federal minimum wage as the cost of living rises. As of March 2022, the most

recent adjustment occurred in 2009, when the federal minimum wage was raised from $6.55 to $7.25.

Price floors are sometimes called “price supports,” because they support a price by preventing it from falling

below a certain level. Around the world, many countries have passed laws to create agricultural price supports.

Farm prices and thus farm incomes fluctuate, sometimes widely. Even if, on average, farm incomes are

adequate, some years they can be quite low. The purpose of price supports is to prevent these swings.

The most common way price supports work is that the government enters the market and buys up the product,

adding to demand to keep prices higher than they otherwise would be. According to the Common Agricultural

Policy reform effective in 2019, the European Union (EU) will spend about 58 billion euros per year, or 65.5

billion dollars per year (with the December 2021 exchange rate), or roughly 36% of the EU budget, on price

supports for Europe’s farmers.

Figure 3.22 illustrates the effects of a government program that assures a price above the equilibrium by

focusing on the market for wheat in Europe. In the absence of government intervention, the price would adjust
so that the quantity supplied would equal the quantity demanded at the equilibrium point E0, with price P0 and
quantity Q0. However, policies to keep prices high for farmers keep the price above what would have been the
market equilibrium level—the price Pf shown by the dashed horizontal line in the diagram. The result is a

quantity supplied in excess of the quantity demanded (Qd). When quantity supplied exceeds quantity

demanded, a surplus exists.

Economists estimate that the high-income areas of the world, including the United States, Europe, and Japan,

spend roughly $1 billion per day in supporting their farmers. If the government is willing to purchase the

excess supply (or to provide payments for others to purchase it), then farmers will benefit from the price floor,

but taxpayers and consumers of food will pay the costs. Agricultural economists and policy makers have

offered numerous proposals for reducing farm subsidies. In many countries, however, political support for

subsidies for farmers remains strong. This is either because the population views this as supporting the

traditional rural way of life or because of industry's lobbying power of the agro-business.

74 3 • Demand and Supply

FIGURE 3.22 European Wheat Prices: A Price Floor Example The intersection of demand (D) and supply (S) would
be at the equilibrium point E0. However, a price floor set at Pf holds the price above E0 and prevents it from falling.
The result of the price floor is that the quantity supplied Qs exceeds the quantity demanded Qd. There is excess

supply, also called a surplus.

3.5 Demand, Supply, and Efficiency

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Contrast consumer surplus, producer surplus, and social surplus

• Explain why price floors and price ceilings can be inefficient

• Analyze demand and supply as a social adjustment mechanism

The familiar demand and supply diagram holds within it the concept of economic efficiency. One typical way

that economists define efficiency is when it is impossible to improve the situation of one party without

imposing a cost on another. Conversely, if a situation is inefficient, it becomes possible to benefit at least one

party without imposing costs on others.

Efficiency in the demand and supply model has the same basic meaning: The economy is getting as much

benefit as possible from its scarce resources and all the possible gains from trade have been achieved. In other

words, the optimal amount of each good and service is produced and consumed.

Consumer Surplus, Producer Surplus, Social Surplus

Consider a market for tablet computers, as Figure 3.23 shows. The equilibrium price is $80 and the

equilibrium quantity is 28 million. To see the benefits to consumers, look at the segment of the demand curve

above the equilibrium point and to the left. This portion of the demand curve shows that at least some

demanders would have been willing to pay more than $80 for a tablet.

For example, point J shows that if the price were $90, 20 million tablets would be sold. Those consumers who

would have been willing to pay $90 for a tablet based on the utility they expect to receive from it, but who were

able to pay the equilibrium price of $80, clearly received a benefit beyond what they had to pay. Remember, the

demand curve traces consumers’ willingness to pay for different quantities. The amount that individuals

would have been willing to pay, minus the amount that they actually paid, is called consumer surplus.

Consumer surplus is the area labeled F—that is, the area above the market price and below the demand curve.

Access for free at openstax.org

3.5 • Demand, Supply, and Efficiency 75

FIGURE 3.23 Consumer and Producer Surplus The somewhat triangular area labeled by F shows the area of

consumer surplus, which shows that the equilibrium price in the market was less than what many of the consumers

were willing to pay. Point J on the demand curve shows that, even at the price of $90, consumers would have been

willing to purchase a quantity of 20 million. The somewhat triangular area labeled by G shows the area of producer

surplus, which shows that the equilibrium price received in the market was more than what many of the producers

were willing to accept for their products. For example, point K on the supply curve shows that at a price of $45, firms

would have been willing to supply a quantity of 14 million.

The supply curve shows the quantity that firms are willing to supply at each price. For example, point K in

Figure 3.23 illustrates that, at $45, firms would still have been willing to supply a quantity of 14 million. Those

producers who would have been willing to supply the tablets at $45, but who were instead able to charge the

equilibrium price of $80, clearly received an extra benefit beyond what they required to supply the product.

The extra benefit producers receive from selling a good or service, measured by the price the producer actually

received minus the price the producer would have been willing to accept is called producer surplus. In Figure

3.23, producer surplus is the area labeled G—that is, the area between the market price and the segment of the

supply curve below the equilibrium.

The sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is social surplus, also referred to as economic surplus or

total surplus. In Figure 3.23 we show social surplus as the area F + G. Social surplus is larger at equilibrium

quantity and price than it would be at any other quantity. This demonstrates the economic efficiency of the
market equilibrium. In addition, at the efficient level of output, it is impossible to produce greater consumer

surplus without reducing producer surplus, and it is impossible to produce greater producer surplus without

reducing consumer surplus.

Inefficiency of Price Floors and Price Ceilings

The imposition of a price floor or a price ceiling will prevent a market from adjusting to its equilibrium price

and quantity, and thus will create an inefficient outcome. However, there is an additional twist here. Along with

creating inefficiency, price floors and ceilings will also transfer some consumer surplus to producers, or some

producer surplus to consumers.

Imagine that several firms develop a promising but expensive new drug for treating back pain. If this therapy

is left to the market, the equilibrium price will be $600 per month and 20,000 people will use the drug, as

shown in Figure 3.24 (a). The original level of consumer surplus is T + U and producer surplus is V + W + X.

However, the government decides to impose a price ceiling of $400 to make the drug more affordable. At this

price ceiling, firms in the market now produce only 15,000.

76 3 • Demand and Supply

As a result, two changes occur. First, an inefficient outcome occurs and the total surplus of society is reduced.

The loss in social surplus that occurs when the economy produces at an inefficient quantity is called

deadweight loss. In a very real sense, it is like money thrown away that benefits no one. In Figure 3.24 (a), the

deadweight loss is the area U + W. When deadweight loss exists, it is possible for both consumer and producer

surplus to be higher, in this case because the price control is blocking some suppliers and demanders from

transactions they would both be willing to make.

A second change from the price ceiling is that some of the producer surplus is transferred to consumers. After

the price ceiling is imposed, the new consumer surplus is T + V, while the new producer surplus is X. In other

words, the price ceiling transfers the area of surplus (V) from producers to consumers. Note that the gain to

consumers is less than the loss to producers, which is just another way of seeing the deadweight loss.

FIGURE 3.24 Efficiency and Price Floors and Ceilings (a) The original equilibrium price is $600 with a quantity of

20,000. Consumer surplus is T + U, and producer surplus is V + W + X. A price ceiling is imposed at $400, so firms in

the market now produce only a quantity of 15,000. As a result, the new consumer surplus is T + V, while the new

producer surplus is X. (b) The original equilibrium is $8 at a quantity of 1,800. Consumer surplus is G + H + J, and

producer surplus is I + K. A price floor is imposed at $12, which means that quantity demanded falls to 1,400. As a

result, the new consumer surplus is G, and the new producer surplus is H + I.

Figure 3.24 (b) shows a price floor example using a string of struggling movie theaters, all in the same city. The

current equilibrium is $8 per movie ticket, with 1,800 people attending movies. The original consumer surplus

is G + H + J, and producer surplus is I + K. The city government is worried that movie theaters will go out of

business, reducing the entertainment options available to citizens, so it decides to impose a price floor of $12

per ticket. As a result, the quantity demanded of movie tickets falls to 1,400. The new consumer surplus is G,

and the new producer surplus is H + I. In effect, the price floor causes the area H to be transferred from

consumer to producer surplus, but also causes a deadweight loss of J + K.

This analysis shows that a price ceiling, like a law establishing rent controls, will transfer some producer

surplus to consumers—which helps to explain why consumers often favor them. Conversely, a price floor like a

guarantee that farmers will receive a certain price for their crops will transfer some consumer surplus to

producers, which explains why producers often favor them. However, both price floors and price ceilings block

some transactions that buyers and sellers would have been willing to make, and creates deadweight loss.

Removing such barriers, so that prices and quantities can adjust to their equilibrium level, will increase the

economy’s social surplus.

Demand and Supply as a Social Adjustment Mechanism

The demand and supply model emphasizes that prices are not set only by demand or only by supply, but by the

3.5 • Demand, Supply, and Efficiency 77

interaction between the two. In 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether supply

or demand determined a price was like arguing “whether it is the upper or the under blade of a pair of scissors

that cuts a piece of paper.” The answer is that both blades of the demand and supply scissors are always

involved.

The adjustments of equilibrium price and quantity in a market-oriented economy often occur without much

government direction or oversight. If the coffee crop in Brazil suffers a terrible frost, then the supply curve of

coffee shifts to the left and the price of coffee rises. Some people continue to drink coffee and pay the higher

price. Others switch to tea or soft drinks. No government commission is needed to figure out how to adjust

coffee prices, which companies will be allowed to process the remaining supply, which supermarkets in which

cities will get how much coffee to sell, or which consumers will ultimately be allowed to drink the brew. Such

adjustments in response to price changes happen all the time in a market economy, often so smoothly and

rapidly that we barely notice them.

Think for a moment of all the seasonal foods that are available and inexpensive at certain times of the year, like

fresh corn in midsummer, but more expensive at other times of the year. People alter their diets and

restaurants alter their menus in response to these fluctuations in prices without fuss or fanfare. For both the
U.S. economy and the world economy as a whole, markets—that is, demand and supply—are the primary social
mechanism for answering the basic questions about what is produced, how it is produced, and for whom it is

produced.

BRING IT HOME

Why Can We Not Get Enough of Organic Food?
Organic food is grown without synthetic pesticides, chemical fertilizers or genetically modified seeds. In recent

decades, the demand for organic products has increased dramatically. The Organic Trade Association reported sales

increased from $1 billion in 1990 to nearly $62 billion in 2020, more than 90% of which were sales of food

products.

Why, then, are organic foods more expensive than their conventional counterparts? The answer is a clear application

of the theories of supply and demand. As people have learned more about the harmful effects of chemical fertilizers,

growth hormones, pesticides and the like from large-scale factory farming, our tastes and preferences for safer,

organic foods have increased. This change in tastes has been reinforced by increases in income, which allow people

to purchase pricier products, and has made organic foods more mainstream. This shift, in addition to population

growth, has led to an increased demand for organic foods. Graphically, the demand curve has shifted right, and we

have moved up the supply curve as producers have responded to the higher prices by supplying a greater quantity.

In addition to the movement along the supply curve, we have also had an increase in the number of farmers

converting to organic farming over time. This is represented by a shift to the right of the supply curve. Since both

demand and supply have shifted to the right, the resulting equilibrium quantity of organic foods is definitely higher,

but the price will only fall when the increase in supply is larger than the increase in demand. We may need more

time before we see lower prices in organic foods. Since the production costs of these foods may remain higher than

conventional farming, because organic fertilizers and pest management techniques are more expensive, they may

never fully catch up with the lower prices of non-organic foods.

As a final, specific example: The Environmental Working Group’s “Dirty Dozen” list of fruits and vegetables, which

test high for pesticide residue even after washing, was released in April 2013. The inclusion of strawberries on the

list led to an increase in demand for organic strawberries, resulting in both a higher equilibrium price and quantity of

sales.

Key Concepts and Summary

3.1 Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for Goods and Services

A demand schedule is a table that shows the quantity demanded at different prices in the market. A demand

curve shows the relationship between quantity demanded and price in a given market on a graph. The law of

demand states that a higher price typically leads to a lower quantity demanded.

A supply schedule is a table that shows the quantity supplied at different prices in the market. A supply curve

shows the relationship between quantity supplied and price on a graph. The law of supply says that a higher

price typically leads to a higher quantity supplied.

The equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity occur where the supply and demand curves cross. The

equilibrium occurs where the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied. If the price is below the

equilibrium level, then the quantity demanded will exceed the quantity supplied. Excess demand or a shortage

will exist. If the price is above the equilibrium level, then the quantity supplied will exceed the quantity

demanded. Excess supply or a surplus will exist. In either case, economic pressures will push the price toward

the equilibrium level.

3.2 Shifts in Demand and Supply for Goods and Services

Economists often use the ceteris paribusor “other things being equal” assumption: while examining the

economic impact of one event, all other factors remain unchanged for analysis purposes. Factors that can shift

the demand curve for goods and services, causing a different quantity to be demanded at any given price,

include changes in tastes, population, income, prices of substitute or complement goods, and expectations

about future conditions and prices. Factors that can shift the supply curve for goods and services, causing a

different quantity to be supplied at any given price, include input prices, natural conditions, changes in
technology, and government taxes, regulations, or subsidies.

3.3 Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity: The Four-Step Process

When using the supply and demand framework to think about how an event will affect the equilibrium price

and quantity, proceed through four steps: (1) sketch a supply and demand diagram to think about what the

market looked like before the event; (2) decide whether the event will affect supply or demand; (3) decide

whether the effect on supply or demand is negative or positive, and draw the appropriate shifted supply or

demand curve; (4) compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original ones.

3.4 Price Ceilings and Price Floors

Price ceilings prevent a price from rising above a certain level. When a price ceiling is set below the

equilibrium price, quantity demanded will exceed quantity supplied, and excess demand or shortages will

result. Price floors prevent a price from falling below a certain level. When a price floor is set above the

equilibrium price, quantity supplied will exceed quantity demanded, and excess supply or surpluses will

result. Price floors and price ceilings often lead to unintended consequences.

3.5 Demand, Supply, and Efficiency

Consumer surplus is the gap between the price that consumers are willing to pay, based on their preferences,

and the market equilibrium price. Producer surplus is the gap between the price for which producers are

willing to sell a product, based on their costs, and the market equilibrium price. Social surplus is the sum of

consumer surplus and producer surplus. Total surplus is larger at the equilibrium quantity and price than it

will be at any other quantity and price. Deadweight loss is loss in total surplus that occurs when the economy

produces at an inefficient quantity.

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES

In this chapter, you will learn about:

• The Market System as an Efficient Mechanism for Information

Introduction to Labor and Financial Markets

BRING IT HOME

Baby Boomers Come of Age
According to the 2020 Census, 22% of the U.S. population was 60 years old or older, which means that more than

74 million people have reached an age when they will need increased medical care.

The baby boomer population, the group born between 1946 and 1964, is comprised of more than 71 million people

who have already reached retirement age or will soon reach retirement. As this population grows older, they will be

faced with common healthcare issues such as heart conditions, arthritis, and Alzheimer’s that may require

hospitalization, long-term, or at-home nursing care. Aging baby boomers and advances in life-saving and life-

extending technologies will increase the demand for healthcare and nursing. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act,

88 4 • Labor and Financial Markets

which expands access to healthcare for millions of Americans, has further increased the demand.

These data tell us, as economists, that the market for healthcare professionals, and nurses in particular, will face

several challenges. Our study of supply and demand will help us to analyze what might happen in the labor market

for nursing and other healthcare professionals, as we will discuss in the second half of this case at the end of the

chapter.

The theories of supply and demand do not apply just to markets for goods. They apply to any market, even

markets for things we may not think of as goods and services like labor and financial services. Labor markets

are markets for employees or jobs. Financial services markets are markets for saving or borrowing.

When we think about demand and supply curves in goods and services markets, it is easy to picture the

demanders and suppliers: businesses produce the products and households buy them. Who are the

demanders and suppliers in labor and financial service markets? In labor markets job seekers (individuals) are

the suppliers of labor, while firms and other employers who hire labor are the demanders for labor. In financial

markets, any individual or firm who saves contributes to the supply of money, and any entity that borrows

(person, firm, or government) contributes to the demand for money.

As a college student, you most likely participate in both labor and financial markets. Employment is a fact of

life for most college students: According to the National Center for Educational Statistics, in 2018 43% of full-

time college students and 81% of part-time college students were employed. Most college students are also

heavily involved in financial markets, primarily as borrowers. As of the 2018–19 school year, 43% of full-time

undergraduate students were receiving loan aid to help finance their education, and those loans averaged

$7,300 per year. Many students also borrow for other expenses, like purchasing a car. As this chapter will

illustrate, we can analyze labor markets and financial markets with the same tools we use to analyze demand

and supply in the goods markets.

4.1 Demand and Supply at Work in Labor Markets

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Predict shifts in the demand and supply curves of the labor market

• Explain the impact of new technology on the demand and supply curves of the labor market

• Explain price floors in the labor market such as minimum wage or a living wage

Markets for labor have demand and supply curves, just like markets for goods. The law of demand applies in

labor markets this way: A higher salary or wage—that is, a higher price in the labor market—leads to a

decrease in the quantity of labor demanded by employers, while a lower salary or wage leads to an increase in
the quantity of labor demanded. The law of supply functions in labor markets, too: A higher price for labor

leads to a higher quantity of labor supplied; a lower price leads to a lower quantity supplied.

Equilibrium in the Labor Market

In 2020, nearly 41,000 registered nurses worked in the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, Minnesota-

Wisconsin metropolitan area, according to the BLS. They worked for a variety of employers: hospitals, doctors’

offices, schools, health clinics, and nursing homes. Figure 4.2 illustrates how demand and supply determine

equilibrium in this labor market. The demand and supply schedules in Table 4.1 list the quantity supplied and

quantity demanded of nurses at different salaries.

FIGURE 4.2 Labor Market Example: Demand and Supply for Nurses in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington The

demand curve (D) of those employers who want to hire nurses intersects with the supply curve (S) of those who are

qualified and willing to work as nurses at the equilibrium point (E). The equilibrium salary is $85,000 and the

equilibrium quantity is 41,000 nurses. At an above-equilibrium salary of $90,000, quantity supplied increases to

45,000, but the quantity of nurses demanded at the higher pay declines to 40,000. At this above-equilibrium salary,

an excess supply or surplus of nurses would exist. At a below-equilibrium salary of $75,000, quantity supplied

declines to 34,000, while the quantity demanded at the lower wage increases to 47,000 nurses. At this below-

equilibrium salary, excess demand or a shortage exists.

TABLE 4.1 Demand and Supply of Nurses in Minneapolis-St.

Paul-Bloomington

The horizontal axis shows the quantity of nurses hired. In this example we measure labor by number of

workers, but another common way to measure the quantity of labor is by the number of hours worked. The

vertical axis shows the price for nurses’ labor—that is, how much they are paid. In the real world, this “price”

would be total labor compensation: salary plus benefits. It is not obvious, but benefits are a significant part (as

high as 30 percent) of labor compensation. In this example we measure the price of labor by salary on an

annual basis, although in other cases we could measure the price of labor by monthly or weekly pay, or even
the wage paid per hour. As the salary for nurses rises, the quantity demanded will fall. Some hospitals and

nursing homes may reduce the number of nurses they hire, or they may lay off some of their existing nurses,

rather than pay them higher salaries. Employers who face higher nurses’ salaries may also try to replace some

nursing functions by investing in physical equipment, like computer monitoring and diagnostic systems to

monitor patients, or by using lower-paid health care aides to reduce the number of nurses they need.

90 4 • Labor and Financial Markets

As the salary for nurses rises, the quantity supplied will rise. If nurses’ salaries in Minneapolis-St. Paul-

Bloomington are higher than in other cities, more nurses will move to Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington to

find jobs, more people will be willing to train as nurses, and those currently trained as nurses will be more

likely to pursue nursing as a full-time job. In other words, there will be more nurses looking for jobs in the

area.

At equilibrium, the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded are equal. Thus, every employer who wants

to hire a nurse at this equilibrium wage can find a willing worker, and every nurse who wants to work at this

equilibrium salary can find a job. In Figure 4.2, the supply curve (S) and demand curve (D) intersect at the

equilibrium point (E). The equilibrium quantity of nurses in the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington area is

41,000, and the equilibrium salary is $86,000 per year. This example simplifies the nursing market by

focusing on the “average” nurse. In reality, of course, the market for nurses actually comprises many smaller

markets, like markets for nurses with varying degrees of experience and credentials. Many markets contain

closely related products that differ in quality. For instance, even a simple product like gasoline comes in

regular, premium, and super-premium, each with a different price. Even in such cases, discussing the average

price of gasoline, like the average salary for nurses, can still be useful because it reflects what is happening in

most of the submarkets.

When the price of labor is not at the equilibrium, economic incentives tend to move salaries toward the

equilibrium. For example, if salaries for nurses in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington were above the

equilibrium at $90,000 per year, then 43,000 people want to work as nurses, but employers want to hire only

39,000 nurses. At that above-equilibrium salary, excess supply or a surplus results. In a situation of excess

supply in the labor market, with many applicants for every job opening, employers will have an incentive to

offer lower wages than they otherwise would have. Nurses’ salary will move down toward equilibrium.

In contrast, if the salary is below the equilibrium at, say, $60,000 per year, then a situation of excess demand or

a shortage arises. In this case, employers encouraged by the relatively lower wage want to hire 40,000 nurses,

but only 27,000 individuals want to work as nurses at that salary in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington. In

response to the shortage, some employers will offer higher pay to attract the nurses. Other employers will have

to match the higher pay to keep their own employees. The higher salaries will encourage more nurses to train

or work in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington. Again, price and quantity in the labor market will move toward

equilibrium.

Shifts in Labor Demand

The demand curve for labor shows the quantity of labor employers wish to hire at any given salary or wage

rate, under the ceteris paribusassumption. A change in the wage or salary will result in a change in the

quantity demanded of labor. If the wage rate increases, employers will want to hire fewer employees. The
quantity of labor demanded will decrease, and there will be a movement upward along the demand curve. If

the wages and salaries decrease, employers are more likely to hire a greater number of workers. The quantity

of labor demanded will increase, resulting in a downward movement along the demand curve.

Shifts in the demand curve for labor occur for many reasons. One key reason is that the demand for labor is

based on the demand for the good or service that is produced. For example, the more new automobiles

consumers demand, the greater the number of workers automakers will need to hire. Therefore the demand

for labor is called a “derived demand.” Here are some examples of derived demand for labor:

• The demand for chefs is dependent on the demand for restaurant meals.

• The demand for pharmacists is dependent on the demand for prescription drugs.

• The demand for attorneys is dependent on the demand for legal services.

As the demand for the goods and services increases, the demand for labor will increase, or shift to the right, to

meet employers’ production requirements. As the demand for the goods and services decreases, the demand

for labor will decrease, or shift to the left. Table 4.2 shows that in addition to the derived demand for labor,

Access for free at openstax.org

4.1 • Demand and Supply at Work in Labor Markets 91

demand can also increase or decrease (shift) in response to several factors.

Factors

Results

Demand for

When the demand for the good produced (output) increases, both the output price and profitability

Output

increase. As a result, producers demand more labor to ramp up production.

Education

and Training

A well-trained and educated workforce causes an increase in the demand for that labor by

employers. Increased levels of productivity within the workforce will cause the demand for labor to

shift to the right. If the workforce is not well-trained or educated, employers will not hire from

within that labor pool, since they will need to spend a significant amount of time and money

training that workforce. Demand for such will shift to the left.

Technology changes can act as either substitutes for or complements to labor. When technology

acts as a substitute, it replaces the need for the number of workers an employer needs to hire. For

example, word processing decreased the number of typists needed in the workplace. This shifted

the demand curve for typists left. An increase in the availability of certain technologies may

increase the demand for labor. Technology that acts as a complement to labor will increase the

Technology

demand for certain types of labor, resulting in a rightward shift of the demand curve. For example,

the increased use of word processing and other software has increased the demand for information

technology professionals who can resolve software and hardware issues related to a firm’s

network. More and better technology will increase demand for skilled workers who know how to

use technology to enhance workplace productivity. Those workers who do not adapt to changes in

technology will experience a decrease in demand.

An increase in the number of companies producing a given product will increase the demand for

labor resulting in a shift to the right. A decrease in the number of companies producing a given

product will decrease the demand for labor resulting in a shift to the left.

Complying with government regulations can increase or decrease the demand for labor at any given

wage. In the healthcare industry, government rules may require that nurses be hired to carry out

certain medical procedures. This will increase the demand for nurses. Less-trained healthcare

workers would be prohibited from carrying out these procedures, and the demand for these

workers will shift to the left.

Labor is not the only input into the production process. For example, a salesperson at a call center

needs a telephone and a computer terminal to enter data and record sales. If prices of other inputs
fall, production will become more profitable and suppliers will demand more labor to increase

production. This will cause a rightward shift in the demand curve for labor. The opposite is also

true. Higher prices for other inputs lower demand for labor.

Shifts in Labor Supply

The supply of labor is upward-sloping and adheres to the law of supply: The higher the price, the greater the

quantity supplied and the lower the price, the less quantity supplied. The supply curve models the tradeoff

between supplying labor into the market or using time in leisure activities at every given price level. The

higher the wage, the more labor is willing to work and forego leisure activities. Table 4.3 lists some of the

factors that will cause the supply to increase or decrease.

Factors

Results

Number of

Workers

Required

Education

An increased number of workers will cause the supply curve to shift to the right. An increased

number of workers can be due to several factors, such as immigration, increasing population, an

aging population, and changing demographics. Policies that encourage immigration will increase

the supply of labor, and vice versa. Population grows when birth rates exceed death rates. This

eventually increases supply of labor when the former reach working age. Another example of

changing demographics is more women working outside of the home, which increases the supply

of labor.

The more required education, the lower the supply. There is a lower supply of PhD mathematicians

than of high school mathematics teachers; there is a lower supply of cardiologists than of primary

care physicians; and there is a lower supply of physicians than of nurses.

Government policies can also affect the supply of labor for jobs. Alternatively, the government may

support rules that set high qualifications for certain jobs: academic training, certificates or licenses,

or experience. When these qualifications are made tougher, the number of qualified workers will

decrease at any given wage. On the other hand, the government may also subsidize training or even

reduce the required level of qualifications. For example, government might offer subsidies for

Government

nursing schools or nursing students. Such provisions would shift the supply curve of nurses to the

Policies

right. In addition, government policies that change the relative desirability of working versus not

working also affect the labor supply. These include unemployment benefits, maternity leave, child

care benefits, and welfare policy. For example, child care benefits may increase the labor supply of

working mothers. Long term unemployment benefits may discourage job searching for unemployed

workers. All these policies must therefore be carefully designed to minimize any negative labor

supply effects.

TABLE 4.3 Factors that Can Shift Supply

A change in salary will lead to a movement along labor demand or labor supply curves, but it will not shift

those curves. However, other events like those we have outlined here will cause either the demand or the

supply of labor to shift, and thus will move the labor market to a new equilibrium salary and quantity.

Technology and Wage Inequality: The Four-Step Process

Economic events can change the equilibrium salary (or wage) and quantity of labor. Consider how the wave of

new information technologies, like computer and telecommunications networks, has affected low-skill and

high-skill workers in the U.S. economy. From the perspective of employers who demand labor, these new

technologies are often a substitute for low-skill laborers like file clerks who used to keep file cabinets full of

paper records of transactions. However, the same new technologies are a complement to high-skill workers

like managers, who benefit from the technological advances by having the ability to monitor more information,

communicate more easily, and juggle a wider array of responsibilities. How will the new technologies affect the

wages of high-skill and low-skill workers? For this question, the four-step process of analyzing how shifts in

supply or demand affect a market (introduced in Demand and Supply) works in this way:

Step 1. What did the markets for low-skill labor and high-skill labor look like before the arrival of the new
technologies? In Figure 4.3 (a) and Figure 4.3 (b), S0 is the original supply curve for labor and D0 is the original
demand curve for labor in each market. In each graph, the original point of equilibrium, E0, occurs at the price

W0 and the quantity Q0.

4.1 • Demand and Supply at Work in Labor Markets 93

FIGURE 4.3 Technology and Wages: Applying Demand and Supply (a) The demand for low-skill labor shifts to the

left when technology can do the job previously done by these workers. (b) New technologies can also increase the

demand for high-skill labor in fields such as information technology and network administration.

Step 2. Does the new technology affect the supply of labor from households or the demand for labor from

firms? The technology change described here affects demand for labor by firms that hire workers.

Step 3. Will the new technology increase or decrease demand? Based on the description earlier, as the
substitute for low-skill labor becomes available, demand for low-skill labor will shift to the left, from D0 to D1.
As the technology complement for high-skill labor becomes cheaper, demand for high-skill labor will shift to
the right, from D0 to D1.

Step 4. The new equilibrium for low-skill labor, shown as point E1 with price W1 and quantity Q1, has a lower
wage and quantity hired than the original equilibrium, E0. The new equilibrium for high-skill labor, shown as
point E1 with price W1 and quantity Q1, has a higher wage and quantity hired than the original equilibrium
(E0).

Thus, the demand and supply model predicts that the new computer and communications technologies will

raise the pay of high-skill workers but reduce the pay of low-skill workers. From the 1970s to the mid-2000s,

the wage gap widened between high-skill and low-skill labor. According to the National Center for Education

Statistics, in 1980, for example, a college graduate earned about 30% more than a high school graduate with

comparable job experience, but by 2019, a college graduate earned about 59% more than an otherwise

comparable high school graduate. Many economists believe that the trend toward greater wage inequality

across the U.S. economy is due to improvements in technology.

Price Floors in the Labor Market: Living Wages and Minimum Wages

In contrast to goods and services markets, price ceilings are rare in labor markets, because rules that prevent

people from earning income are not politically popular. There is one exception: boards of trustees or

stockholders, as an example, propose limits on the high incomes of top business executives.

94 4 • Labor and Financial Markets

The labor market, however, presents some prominent examples of price floors, which are an attempt to

increase the wages of low-paid workers. The U.S. government sets a minimum wage, a price floor that makes it

illegal for an employer to pay employees less than a certain hourly rate. In mid-2009, the U.S. minimum wage

was raised to $7.25 per hour. Local political movements in a number of U.S. cities have pushed for a higher

minimum wage, which they call a living wage. Promoters of living wage laws maintain that the minimum wage

is too low to ensure a reasonable standard of living. They base this conclusion on the calculation that, if you

work 40 hours a week at a minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for 50 weeks a year, your annual income is

$14,500, which is less than the official U.S. government definition of what it means for a family to be in poverty.

(A family with two adults earning minimum wage and two young children will find it more cost efficient for one

parent to provide childcare while the other works for income. Thus the family income would be $14,500, which

is significantly lower than the federal poverty line for a family of four, which was $26,500 in 2021.)

Supporters of the living wage argue that full-time workers should be assured a high enough wage so that they

can afford the essentials of life: food, clothing, shelter, and healthcare. Since Baltimore passed the first living

wage law in 1994, several dozen cities enacted similar laws in the late 1990s and the 2000s. The living wage

ordinances do not apply to all employers, but they have specified that all employees of the city or employees of

firms that the city hires be paid at least a certain wage that is usually a few dollars per hour above the U.S.

minimum wage.

Figure 4.4 illustrates the situation of a city considering a living wage law. For simplicity, we assume that there

is no federal minimum wage. The wage appears on the vertical axis, because the wage is the price in the labor

market. Before the passage of the living wage law, the equilibrium wage is $10 per hour and the city hires 1,200

workers at this wage. However, a group of concerned citizens persuades the city council to enact a living wage

law requiring employers to pay no less than $12 per hour. In response to the higher wage, 1,600 workers look

for jobs with the city. At this higher wage, the city, as an employer, is willing to hire only 700 workers. At the

price floor, the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, and a surplus of labor exists in this market.

For workers who continue to have a job at a higher salary, life has improved. For those who were willing to

work at the old wage rate but lost their jobs with the wage increase, life has not improved. Table 4.4 shows the

differences in supply and demand at different wages.

FIGURE 4.4 A Living Wage: Example of a Price Floor The original equilibrium in this labor market is a wage of $10/

hour and a quantity of 1,200 workers, shown at point E. Imposing a wage floor at $12/hour leads to an excess

supply of labor. At that wage, the quantity of labor supplied is 1,600 and the quantity of labor demanded is only 700.

TABLE 4.4 Living Wage: Example of a Price Floor

The Minimum Wage as an Example of a Price Floor

The U.S. minimum wage is a price floor that is set either very close to the equilibrium wage or even slightly

below it. About 1.5% of hourly workers in the U.S. are paid the minimum wage. In other words, the vast

majority of the U.S. labor force has its wages determined in the labor market, not as a result of the government

price floor. However, for workers with low skills and little experience, like those without a high school diploma

or teenagers, the minimum wage is quite important. In many cities, the federal minimum wage is apparently

below the market price for unskilled labor, because employers offer more than the minimum wage to checkout

clerks and other low-skill workers without any government prodding.

Economists have attempted to estimate how much the minimum wage reduces the quantity demanded of low-

skill labor. A typical result of such studies is that a 10% increase in the minimum wage would decrease the

hiring of unskilled workers by 1 to 2%, which seems a relatively small reduction. In fact, some studies have

even found no effect of a higher minimum wage on employment at certain times and places—although these

studies are controversial. Well-known economists Walter Williams and Thomas Sowell, who both focus on the

intersections of race and economics, argue that minimum wages increase discrimination and limit economic

mobility. Williams, for example, indicates that higher minimum wages would increase employment barriers

for lower-skilled workers, reducing the opportunity for them to learn on the job and gain experience that

would give them more choice in employment.

Let’s suppose that the minimum wage lies just slightly belowthe equilibrium wage level. Wages could fluctuate

according to market forces above this price floor, but they would not be allowed to move beneath the floor. In

this situation, the price floor minimum wage is nonbinding—that is, the price floor is not determining the

market outcome. Even if the minimum wage moves just a little higher, it will still have no effect on the quantity

of employment in the economy, as long as it remains below the equilibrium wage. Even if the government

increases the minimum wage by enough so that it rises slightly above the equilibrium wage and becomes

binding, there will be only a small excess supply gap between the quantity demanded and quantity supplied.

These insights help to explain why U.S. minimum wage laws have historically had only a small impact on

employment. Since the minimum wage has typically been set close to the equilibrium wage for low-skill labor

and sometimes even below it, it has not had a large effect in creating an excess supply of labor. However, if the

minimum wage increased dramatically—say, if it doubled to match the living wages that some U.S. cities have

considered—then its impact on reducing the quantity demanded of employment would be far greater. The

following Clear It Up feature describes in greater detail some of the arguments for and against changes to the

minimum wage.

96 4 • Labor and Financial Markets

CLEAR IT UP

What’s the harm in raising the minimum wage?
Because of the law of demand, a higher required wage will reduce the amount of low-skill employment either in

terms of employees or in terms of work hours. Although there is controversy over the numbers, let’s say for the sake

of the argument that a 10% rise in the minimum wage will reduce the employment of low-skill workers by 2%. Does

this outcome mean that raising the minimum wage by 10% is bad public policy? Not necessarily.

If 98% of those receiving the minimum wage have a pay increase of 10%, but 2% of those receiving the minimum

wage lose their jobs, are the gains for society as a whole greater than the losses? The answer is not clear, because

job losses, even for a small group, may cause more pain than modest income gains for others. For one thing, we

need to consider which minimum wage workers are losing their jobs. If the 2% of minimum wage workers who lose

their jobs are struggling to support families, that is one thing. If those who lose their job are high school students

picking up spending money over summer vacation, that is something else.

Another complexity is that many minimum wage workers do not work full-time for an entire year. Imagine a

minimum wage worker who holds different part-time jobs for a few months at a time, with bouts of unemployment

in between. The worker in this situation receives the 10% raise in the minimum wage when working, but also ends

up working 2% fewer hours during the year because the higher minimum wage reduces how much employers want

people to work. Overall, this worker’s income would rise because the 10% pay raise would more than offset the 2%

fewer hours worked.

Of course, these arguments do not prove that raising the minimum wage is necessarily a good idea either. There may

well be other, better public policy options for helping low-wage workers. (The Poverty and Economic Inequality

(http://openstax.org/books/principles-economics-3e/pages/15-introduction-to-poverty-and-economic-inequality)

chapter discusses some possibilities.) The lesson from this maze of minimum wage arguments is that complex

social problems rarely have simple answers. Even those who agree on how a proposed economic policy affects

quantity demanded and quantity supplied may still disagree on whether the policy is a good idea.

4.2 Demand and Supply in Financial Markets

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•

Identify the demanders and suppliers in a financial market

• Explain how interest rates can affect supply and demand

• Analyze the economic effects of U.S. debt in terms of domestic financial markets

• Explain the role of price ceilings and usury laws in the U.S.

United States' households, institutions, and domestic businesses saved almost $1.3 trillion in 2015. Where did

that savings go and how was it used? Some of the savings ended up in banks, which in turn loaned the money

to individuals or businesses that wanted to borrow money. Some was invested in private companies or loaned

to government agencies that wanted to borrow money to raise funds for purposes like building roads or mass

transit. Some firms reinvested their savings in their own businesses.

In this section, we will determine how the demand and supply model links those who wish to supply financial

capital (i.e., savings) with those who demand financial capital (i.e., borrowing). Those who save money (or

make financial investments, which is the same thing), whether individuals or businesses, are on the supply

side of the financial market. Those who borrow money are on the demand side of the financial market. For a

more detailed treatment of the different kinds of financial investments like bank accounts, stocks and bonds,

see the Financial Markets (http://openstax.org/books/principles-economics-3e/pages/17-introduction-to-

financial-markets) chapter.

4.2 • Demand and Supply in Financial Markets 97

Who Demands and Who Supplies in Financial Markets?

In any market, the price is what suppliers receive and what demanders pay. In financial markets, those who

supply financial capital through saving expect to receive a rate of return, while those who demand financial

capital by receiving funds expect to pay a rate of return. This rate of return can come in a variety of forms,

depending on the type of investment.

The simplest example of a rate of return is the interest rate. For example, when you supply money into a

savings account at a bank, you receive interest on your deposit. The interest the bank pays you as a percent of

your deposits is the interest rate. Similarly, if you demand a loan to buy a car or a computer, you will need to

pay interest on the money you borrow.

Let’s consider the market for borrowing money with credit cards. In 2021, almost 200 million Americans were

cardholders. Credit cards allow you to borrow money from the card's issuer, and pay back the borrowed

amount plus interest, although most allow you a period of time in which you can repay the loan without paying

interest. A typical credit card interest rate ranges from 12% to 18% per year. In May 2021, Americans had

about $807 billion outstanding in credit card debts. As of 2021, just over 45% of American families carried

some credit card debt. Let’s say that, on average, the annual interest rate for credit card borrowing is 15% per

year. Thus, Americans pay tens of billions of dollars every year in interest on their credit cards—plus basic fees

for the credit card or fees for late payments.

Figure 4.5 illustrates demand and supply in the financial market for credit cards. The horizontal axis of the

financial market shows the quantity of money loaned or borrowed in this market. The vertical or price axis

shows the rate of return, which in the case of credit card borrowing we can measure with an interest rate. Table

4.5 shows the quantity of financial capital that consumers demand at various interest rates and the quantity

that credit card firms (often banks) are willing to supply.

FIGURE 4.5 Demand and Supply for Borrowing Money with Credit Cards In this market for credit card borrowing,

the demand curve (D) for borrowing financial capital intersects the supply curve (S) for lending financial capital at

equilibrium E. At the equilibrium, the interest rate (the “price” in this market) is 15% and the quantity of financial

capital loaned and borrowed is $600 billion. The equilibrium price is where the quantity demanded and the quantity

supplied are equal. At an above-equilibrium interest rate like 21%, the quantity of financial capital supplied would

increase to $750 billion, but the quantity demanded would decrease to $480 billion. At a below-equilibrium interest

rate like 13%, the quantity of financial capital demanded would increase to $700 billion, but the quantity of financial

capital supplied would decrease to $510 billion.

TABLE 4.5 Demand and Supply for Borrowing Money with Credit Cards

The laws of demand and supply continue to apply in the financial markets. According to the law of demand, a
higher rate of return (that is, a higher price) will decrease the quantity demanded. As the interest rate rises,

consumers will reduce the quantity that they borrow. According to the law of supply, a higher price increases

the quantity supplied. Consequently, as the interest rate paid on credit card borrowing rises, more firms will be

eager to issue credit cards and to encourage customers to use them. Conversely, if the interest rate on credit

cards falls, the quantity of financial capital supplied in the credit card market will decrease and the quantity

demanded will increase.

Equilibrium in Financial Markets

In the financial market for credit cards in Figure 4.5, the supply curve (S) and the demand curve (D) cross at

the equilibrium point (E). The equilibrium occurs at an interest rate of 15%, where the quantity of funds

demanded and the quantity supplied are equal at an equilibrium quantity of $600 billion.

If the interest rate (remember, this measures the “price” in the financial market) is above the equilibrium level,

then an excess supply, or a surplus, of financial capital will arise in this market. For example, at an interest rate

of 21%, the quantity of funds supplied increases to $750 billion, while the quantity demanded decreases to

$480 billion. At this above-equilibrium interest rate, firms are eager to supply loans to credit card borrowers,

but relatively few people or businesses wish to borrow. As a result, some credit card firms will lower the

interest rates (or other fees) they charge to attract more business. This strategy will push the interest rate down

toward the equilibrium level.

If the interest rate is below the equilibrium, then excess demand or a shortage of funds occurs in this market.

At an interest rate of 13%, the quantity of funds credit card borrowers demand increases to $700 billion, but

the quantity credit card firms are willing to supply is only $510 billion. In this situation, credit card firms will

perceive that they are overloaded with eager borrowers and conclude that they have an opportunity to raise

interest rates or fees. The interest rate will face economic pressures to creep up toward the equilibrium level.

The FRED database publishes some two dozen measures of interest rates, including interest rates on credit

cards, automobile loans, personal loans, mortgage loans, and more. You can find these at the FRED website

(https://openstax.org/l/FRED_stlouis).

Shifts in Demand and Supply in Financial Markets

Those who supply financial capital face two broad decisions: how much to save, and how to divide up their

savings among different forms of financial investments. We will discuss each of these in turn.

Participants in financial markets must decide when they prefer to consume goods: now or in the future.

Access for free at openstax.org

4.2 • Demand and Supply in Financial Markets 99

Economists call this intertemporal decision making because it involves decisions across time. Unlike a

decision about what to buy from the grocery store, people make investment or savings decisions across a

period of time, sometimes a long period.

Most workers save for retirement because their income in the present is greater than their needs, while the

opposite will be true once they retire. Thus, they save today and supply financial markets. If their income

increases, they save more. If their perceived situation in the future changes, they change the amount of their

saving. For example, there is some evidence that Social Security, the program that workers pay into in order to

qualify for government checks after retirement, has tended to reduce the quantity of financial capital that

workers save. If this is true, Social Security has shifted the supply of financial capital at any interest rate to the

left.

By contrast, many college students need money today when their income is low (or nonexistent) to pay their

college expenses. As a result, they borrow today and demand from financial markets. Once they graduate and

become employed, they will pay back the loans. Individuals borrow money to purchase homes or cars. A

business seeks financial investment so that it has the funds to build a factory or invest in a research and

development project that will not pay off for five years, ten years, or even more. Thus, when consumers and
businesses have greater confidence that they will be able to repay in the future, the quantity demanded of
financial capital at any given interest rate will shift to the right.

For example, in the technology boom of the late 1990s, many businesses became extremely confident that

investments in new technology would have a high rate of return, and their demand for financial capital shifted

to the right. Conversely, during the 2008 and 2009 Great Recession, their demand for financial capital at any

given interest rate shifted to the left.

To this point, we have been looking at saving in total. Now let us consider what affects saving in different types

of financial investments. In deciding between different forms of financial investments, suppliers of financial

capital will have to consider the rates of return and the risks involved. Rate of return is a positive attribute of

investments, but risk is a negative. If Investment A becomes more risky, or the return diminishes, then savers

will shift their funds to Investment B—and the supply curve of financial capital for Investment A will shift back

to the left while the supply curve of capital for Investment B shifts to the right.

The United States as a Global Borrower

In the global economy, trillions of dollars of financial investment cross national borders every year. In the early

2000s, financial investors from foreign countries were investing several hundred billion dollars per year more

in the U.S. economy than U.S. financial investors were investing abroad. The following Work It Out deals with

one of the macroeconomic concerns for the U.S. economy in recent years.

WORK IT OUT

The Effect of Growing U.S. Debt
Imagine that foreign investors viewed the U.S. economy as a less desirable place to put their money because of

fears about the growth of the U.S. public debt. Using the four-step process for analyzing how changes in supply

and demand affect equilibrium outcomes, how would increased U.S. public debt affect the equilibrium price and

quantity for capital in U.S. financial markets?

Step 1. Draw a diagram showing demand and supply for financial capital that represents the original scenario in

which foreign investors are pouring money into the U.S. economy. Figure 4.6 shows a demand curve, D, and a

supply curve, S, where the supply of capital includes the funds arriving from foreign investors. The original
equilibrium E0 occurs at interest rate R0 and quantity of financial investment Q0.

100 4 • Labor and Financial Markets

FIGURE 4.6 The United States as a Global Borrower Before U.S. Debt Uncertainty The graph shows the demand

for financial capital from and supply of financial capital into the U.S. financial markets by the foreign sector
before the increase in uncertainty regarding U.S. public debt. The original equilibrium (E0) occurs at an
equilibrium rate of return (R0) and the equilibrium quantity is at Q0.

Step 2. Will the diminished confidence in the U.S. economy as a place to invest affect demand or supply of

financial capital? Yes, it will affect supply. Many foreign investors look to the U.S. financial markets to store their

money in safe financial vehicles with low risk and stable returns. Diminished confidence means U.S. financial

assets will be seen as more risky.

Step 3. Will supply increase or decrease? When the enthusiasm of foreign investors’ for investing their money in

the U.S. economy diminishes, the supply of financial capital shifts to the left. Figure 4.7 shows the supply curve
shift from S0 to S1.

FIGURE 4.7 The United States as a Global Borrower Before and After U.S. Debt Uncertainty The graph shows the

demand for financial capital and supply of financial capital into the U.S. financial markets by the foreign sector
before and after the increase in uncertainty regarding U.S. public debt. The original equilibrium (E0) occurs at an
equilibrium rate of return (R0) and the equilibrium quantity is at Q0.

Step 4. Thus, foreign investors’ diminished enthusiasm leads to a new equilibrium, E1, which occurs at the higher
interest rate, R1, and the lower quantity of financial investment, Q1. In short, U.S. borrowers will have to pay more
interest on their borrowing.

4.2 • Demand and Supply in Financial Markets 101

The economy has experienced an enormous inflow of foreign capital. According to the U.S. Bureau of

Economic Analysis, by the third quarter of 2021, U.S. investors had accumulated $34.45 trillion of foreign

assets, but foreign investors owned a total of $50.53 trillion of U.S. assets. If foreign investors were to pull their

money out of the U.S. economy and invest elsewhere in the world, the result could be a significantly lower

quantity of financial investment in the United States, available only at a higher interest rate. This reduced

inflow of foreign financial investment could impose hardship on U.S. consumers and firms interested in

borrowing.

In a modern, developed economy, financial capital often moves invisibly through electronic transfers between

one bank account and another. Yet we can analyze these flows of funds with the same tools of demand and

supply as markets for goods or labor.

Price Ceilings in Financial Markets: Usury Laws

As we noted earlier, about 200 million Americans own credit cards, and their interest payments and fees total

tens of billions of dollars each year. It is little wonder that political pressures sometimes arise for setting limits

on the interest rates or fees that credit card companies charge. The firms that issue credit cards, including

banks, oil companies, phone companies, and retail stores, respond that the higher interest rates are necessary

to cover the losses created by those who borrow on their credit cards and who do not repay on time or at all.

These companies also point out that cardholders can avoid paying interest if they pay their bills on time.

Consider the credit card market as Figure 4.8 illustrates. In this financial market, the vertical axis shows the

interest rate (which is the price in the financial market). Demanders in the credit card market are households

and businesses. Suppliers are the companies that issue credit cards. This figure does not use specific

numbers, which would be hypothetical in any case, but instead focuses on the underlying economic

relationships. Imagine a law imposes a price ceiling that holds the interest rate charged on credit cards at the
rate Rc, which lies below the interest rate R0 that would otherwise have prevailed in the market. The horizontal
dashed line at interest rate Rc in Figure 4.8 shows the price ceiling. The demand and supply model predicts
that at the lower price ceiling interest rate, the quantity demanded of credit card debt will increase from its
original level of Q0 to Qd; however, the quantity supplied of credit card debt will decrease from the original Q0
to Qs. At the price ceiling (Rc), quantity demanded will exceed quantity supplied. Consequently, a number of

people who want to have credit cards and are willing to pay the prevailing interest rate will find that companies

are unwilling to issue cards to them. The result will be a credit shortage.

FIGURE 4.8 Credit Card Interest Rates: Another Price Ceiling Example The original intersection of demand D and
supply S occurs at equilibrium E0. However, a price ceiling is set at the interest rate Rc, below the equilibrium
interest rate R0, and so the interest rate cannot adjust upward to the equilibrium. At the price ceiling, the quantity
demanded, Qd, exceeds the quantity supplied, Qs. There is excess demand, also called a shortage.

102 4 • Labor and Financial Markets

Many states do have usury laws, which impose an upper limit on the interest rate that lenders can charge.

However, in many cases these upper limits are well above the market interest rate. For example, if the interest

rate is not allowed to rise above 30% per year, it can still fluctuate below that level according to market forces.

A price ceiling that is set at a relatively high level is nonbinding, and it will have no practical effect unless the

equilibrium price soars high enough to exceed the price ceiling.

4.3 The Market System as an Efficient Mechanism for Information

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Apply demand and supply models to analyze prices and quantities

• Explain the effects of price controls on the equilibrium of prices and quantities

Prices exist in markets for goods and services, for labor, and for financial capital. In all of these markets, prices

serve as a remarkable social mechanism for collecting, combining, and transmitting information that is

relevant to the market—namely, the relationship between demand and supply—and then serving as

messengers to convey that information to buyers and sellers. In a market-oriented economy, no government

agency or guiding intelligence oversees the set of responses and interconnections that result from a change in

price. Instead, each consumer reacts according to that person’s preferences and budget set, and each profit-

seeking producer reacts to the impact on its expected profits. The following Clear It Up feature examines the

demand and supply models.

CLEAR IT UP

Why are demand and supply curves important?
The demand and supply model is the second fundamental diagram for this course. (The opportunity set model that

we introduced in the Choice in a World of Scarcity chapter was the first.) Just as it would be foolish to try to learn the

arithmetic of long division by memorizing every possible combination of numbers that can be divided by each other,

it would be foolish to try to memorize every specific example of demand and supply in this chapter, this textbook, or

this course. Demand and supply is not primarily a list of examples. It is a model to analyze prices and quantities.

Even though demand and supply diagrams have many labels, they are fundamentally the same in their logic. Your

goal should be to understand the underlying model so you can use it to analyze anymarket.

Figure 4.9 displays a generic demand and supply curve. The horizontal axis shows the different measures of

quantity: a quantity of a good or service, or a quantity of labor for a given job, or a quantity of financial capital. The

vertical axis shows a measure of price: the price of a good or service, the wage in the labor market, or the rate of

return (like the interest rate) in the financial market.

The demand and supply model can explain the existing levels of prices, wages, and rates of return. To carry out such

an analysis, think about the quantity that will be demanded at each price and the quantity that will be supplied at

each price—that is, think about the shape of the demand and supply curves—and how these forces will combine to

produce equilibrium.

We can also use demand and supply to explain how economic events will cause changes in prices, wages, and rates

of return. There are only four possibilities: the change in any single event may cause the demand curve to shift right

or to shift left, or it may cause the supply curve to shift right or to shift left. The key to analyzing the effect of an

economic event on equilibrium prices and quantities is to determine which of these four possibilities occurred. The

way to do this correctly is to think back to the list of factors that shift the demand and supply curves. Note that if
more than one variable is changing at the same time, the overall impact will depend on the degree of the shifts.

When there are multiple variables, economists isolate each change and analyze it independently.

FIGURE 4.9 Demand and Supply Curves The figure displays a generic demand and supply curve. The horizontal axis

shows the different measures of quantity: a quantity of a good or service, a quantity of labor for a given job, or a
quantity of financial capital. The vertical axis shows a measure of price: the price of a good or service, the wage in

the labor market, or the rate of return (like the interest rate) in the financial market. We can use the demand and

supply curves explain how economic events will cause changes in prices, wages, and rates of return.

An increase in the price of some product signals consumers that there is a shortage; therefore, they may want

to economize on buying this product. For example, if you are thinking about taking a plane trip to Hawaii, but

the ticket turns out to be expensive during the week you intend to go, you might consider other weeks when the

ticket might be cheaper. The price could be high because you were planning to travel during a holiday when

demand for traveling is high. Maybe the cost of an input like jet fuel increased or the airline has raised the

price temporarily to see how many people are willing to pay it. Perhaps all of these factors are present at the

same time. You do not need to analyze the market and break down the price change into its underlying factors.

You just have to look at the ticket price and decide whether and when to fly.

In the same way, price changes provide useful information to producers. Imagine the situation of a farmer who

grows oats and learns that the price of oats has risen. The higher price could be due to an increase in demand

caused by a new scientific study proclaiming that eating oats is especially healthful. Perhaps the price of a

substitute grain, like corn, has risen, and people have responded by buying more oats. The oat farmer does not

need to know the details. The farmer only needs to know that the price of oats has risen and that it will be
profitable to expand production as a result.

The actions of individual consumers and producers as they react to prices overlap and interlock in markets for

goods, labor, and financial capital. A change in any single market is transmitted through these multiple

interconnections to other markets. The vision of the role of flexible prices helping markets to reach

equilibrium and linking different markets together helps to explain why price controls can be so

counterproductive. Price controls are government laws that serve to regulate prices rather than allow the

various markets to determine prices. There is an old proverb: “Don’t kill the messenger.” In ancient times,

messengers carried information between distant cities and kingdoms. When they brought bad news, there was

an emotional impulse to kill the messenger. However, killing the messenger did not kill the bad news.

Moreover, killing the messenger had an undesirable side effect: Other messengers would refuse to bring news

to that city or kingdom, depriving its citizens of vital information.

Those who seek price controls are trying to kill the messenger—or at least to stifle an unwelcome message that

prices are bringing about the equilibrium level of price and quantity. However, price controls do nothing to

affect the underlying forces of demand and supply, and this can have serious repercussions. During China’s

104 4 • Labor and Financial Markets

“Great Leap Forward” in the late 1950s, the government kept food prices artificially low, with the result that 30

to 40 million people died of starvation because the low prices depressed farm production. This was communist

party leader Mao Zedong's social and economic campaign to rapidly transform the country from an agrarian

economy to a socialist society through rapid industrialization and collectivization. Changes in demand and

supply will continue to reveal themselves through consumers’ and producers’ behavior. Immobilizing the price

messenger through price controls will deprive everyone in the economy of critical information. Without this

information, it becomes difficult for everyone—buyers and sellers alike—to react in a flexible and appropriate

manner as changes occur throughout the economy.

Baby Boomers Come of Age
The theory of supply and demand can explain what happens in the labor markets and suggests that the demand for

nurses will increase as healthcare needs of baby boomers increase, as Figure 4.10 shows. The impact of that

increase will result in an average salary higher than the $75,330 earned in 2020 referenced in the first part of this
case. The new equilibrium (E1) will be at the new equilibrium price (Pe1).Equilibrium quantity will also increase from
Qe0 to Qe1.

FIGURE 4.10 Impact of Increasing Demand for Nurses 2020–2030 In 2020, the median salary for nurses was
$75,330. As demand for services increases, the demand curve shifts to the right (from D0 to D1) and the equilibrium
quantity of nurses increases from Qe0 to Qe1. The equilibrium salary increases from Pe0 to Pe1.

Suppose that as the demand for nurses increases, the supply shrinks due to an increasing number of nurses

entering retirement and increases in the tuition of nursing degrees. The leftward shift of the supply curve in Figure

4.11 captures the impact of a decreasing supply of nurses. The shifts in the two curves result in higher salaries for

nurses, but the overall impact on the quantity of nurses is uncertain, as it depends on the relative shifts of supply

and demand.

FIGURE 4.11 Impact of Decreasing Supply of Nurses between 2020 and 2030 The increase in demand for nurses

shown in Figure 4.10 leads to both higher prices and higher quantities demanded. As nurses retire from the work
force, the supply of nurses decreases, causing a leftward shift in the supply curve and higher salaries for nurses at
Pe2. The net effect on the equilibrium quantity of nurses is uncertain, which in this representation is less than Qe1,
but more than the initial Qe0.

While we do not know if the number of nurses will increase or decrease relative to their initial employment, we know

they will have higher salaries.

Key Concepts and Summary

4.1 Demand and Supply at Work in Labor Markets

In the labor market, households are on the supply side of the market and firms are on the demand side. In the

market for financial capital, households and firms can be on either side of the market: they are suppliers of

financial capital when they save or make financial investments, and demanders of financial capital when they

borrow or receive financial investments.

In the demand and supply analysis of labor markets, we can measure the price by the annual salary or hourly

wage received. We can measure the quantity of labor various ways, like number of workers or the number of

hours worked.

Factors that can shift the demand curve for labor include: a change in the quantity demanded of the product

that the labor produces; a change in the production process that uses more or less labor; and a change in

government policy that affects the quantity of labor that firms wish to hire at a given wage. Demand can also

increase or decrease (shift) in response to: workers’ level of education and training, technology, the number of

companies, and availability and price of other inputs.

The main factors that can shift the supply curve for labor are: how desirable a job appears to workers relative

to the alternatives, government policy that either restricts or encourages the quantity of workers trained for

the job, the number of workers in the economy, and required education.

4.2 Demand and Supply in Financial Markets

In the demand and supply analysis of financial markets, the “price” is the rate of return or the interest rate

received. We measure the quantity by the money that flows from those who supply financial capital to those

who demand it.

Two factors can shift the supply of financial capital to a certain investment: if people want to alter their

existing levels of consumption, and if the riskiness or return on one investment changes relative to other

investments. Factors that can shift demand for capital include business confidence and consumer confidence

in the future—since financial investments received in the present are typically repaid in the future.

4.3 The Market System as an Efficient Mechanism for Information

The market price system provides a highly efficient mechanism for disseminating information about relative

scarcities of goods, services, labor, and financial capital. Market participants do not need to know why prices

have changed, only that the changes require them to revisit previous decisions they made about supply and

demand. Price controls hide information about the true scarcity of products and thereby cause misallocation

of resources.

Introduction to Elasticity

BRING IT HOME

That Will Be How Much?
Imagine going to your favorite coffee shop and having the waiter inform you the pricing has changed. Instead of $3

for a cup of coffee, you will now be charged $2 for coffee, $1 for creamer, and $1 for your choice of sweetener. If you

pay your usual $3 for a cup of coffee, you must choose between creamer and sweetener. If you want both, you now

face an extra charge of $1. Sound absurd? Well, that is similar to the situation Netflix customers found themselves

112 5 • Elasticity

in—they faced a 60% price hike to retain the same service in 2011.

In early 2011, Netflix consumers paid about $10 a month for a package consisting of streaming video and DVD

rentals. In July 2011, the company announced a packaging change. Customers wishing to retain both streaming

video and DVD rental would be charged $15.98 per month, a price increase of about 60%. In 2014, Netflix also

raised its streaming video subscription price from $7.99 to $8.99 per month for new U.S. customers. The company

also changed its policy of 4K streaming content from $9.00 to $12.00 per month that year.

How would customers of the 18-year-old firm react? Would they abandon Netflix? Would the ease of access to other

venues make a difference in how consumers responded to the Netflix price change? At the time, Netflix had few

competitors; in the intervening years, the field has grown to ten major competitors and nearly 200 smaller ones. Is

that likely to have a greater impact than the price changes? We will explore the answers to those questions in this

chapter, which focuses on the change in quantity with respect to a change in price, a concept economists call

elasticity.

Anyone who has studied economics knows the law of demand: a higher price will lead to a lower quantity

demanded. What you may not know is how much lower the quantity demanded will be. Similarly, the law of

supply states that a higher price will lead to a higher quantity supplied. The question is: How much higher?

This chapter will explain how to answer these questions and why they are critically important in the real world.

To find answers to these questions, we need to understand the concept of elasticity. Elasticity is an economics

concept that measures responsiveness of one variable to changes in another variable. Suppose you drop two

items from a second-floor balcony. The first item is a tennis ball. The second item is a brick. Which will bounce

higher? Obviously, the tennis ball. We would say that the tennis ball has greater elasticity.

Consider an economic example. Cigarette taxes are an example of a “sin tax,” a tax on something that is bad for

you, like alcohol. Governments tax cigarettes at the state and national levels. As of 2021, state taxes ranged

from a low of 17 cents per pack in Missouri to $4.35 per pack in Connecticut and New York. The average state

cigarette tax is $1.76 per pack. The 2021 federal tax rate on cigarettes was $1.01 per pack. In 2015, the Obama

Administration proposed raising the federal tax nearly a dollar to $1.95 per pack. The key question is: How

much would cigarette purchases decline?

Taxes on cigarettes serve two purposes: to raise tax revenue for government and to discourage cigarette

consumption. However, if a higher cigarette tax discourages consumption considerably, meaning a greatly

reduced quantity of cigarette sales, then the cigarette tax on each pack will not raise much revenue for the

government. Alternatively, a higher cigarette tax that does not discourage consumption by much will actually

raise more tax revenue for the government. Thus, when a government agency tries to calculate the effects of

altering its cigarette tax, it must analyze how much the tax affects the quantity of cigarettes consumed. This

issue reaches beyond governments and taxes. Every firm faces a similar issue. When a firm considers raising

the sales price, it must consider how much a price increase will reduce the quantity demanded of what it sells.

Conversely, when a firm puts its products on sale, it must expect (or hope) that the lower price will lead to a

significantly higher quantity demanded.

5.1 Price Elasticity of Demand and Price Elasticity of Supply

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Calculate the price elasticity of demand

• Calculate the price elasticity of supply

Both the demand and supply curve show the relationship between price and the number of units demanded or

supplied. Price elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in the quantity demanded (Qd) or

supplied (Qs) and the corresponding percent change in price. The price elasticity of demand is the percentage

5.1 • Price Elasticity of Demand and Price Elasticity of Supply 113

change in the quantity demandedof a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price. The price

elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplieddivided by the percentage change in price.

We can usefully divide elasticities into three broad categories: elastic, inelastic, and unitary. Because price and

quantity demanded move in opposite directions, price elasticity of demand is always a negative number.

Therefore, price elasticity of demand is usually reported as its absolute value, without a negative sign. The

summary in Table 5.1 is assuming absolute values for price elasticity of demand. An elastic demand or elastic

supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one, indicating a high responsiveness to changes in price.

Elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic

demand or inelastic supply. Unitary elasticities indicate proportional responsiveness of either demand or

supply, as Table 5.1 summarizes.

Before we delve into the details of elasticity, enjoy this article (http://openstax.org/l/Super_Bowl) on elasticity

and ticket prices at the Super Bowl.

To calculate elasticity along a demand or supply curve economists use the average percent change in both

quantity and price. This is called the Midpoint Method for Elasticity, and is represented in the following

equations:

The advantage of the Midpoint Method is that one obtains the same elasticity between two price points
whether there is a price increase or decrease. This is because the formula uses the same base (average

quantity and average price) for both cases.

Calculating Price Elasticity of Demand

Let’s calculate the elasticity between points A and B and between points G and H as Figure 5.2 shows.

114 5 • Elasticity

FIGURE 5.2 Calculating the Price Elasticity of Demand We calculate the price elasticity of demand as the

percentage change in quantity divided by the percentage change in price.

First, apply the formula to calculate the elasticity as price decreases from $70 at point B to $60 at point A:

Therefore, the elasticity of demand between these two points is

which is 0.45, an amount smaller than

one, showing that the demand is inelastic in this interval. Price elasticities of demand are alwaysnegative

since price and quantity demanded always move in opposite directions (on the demand curve). By convention,
we always talk about elasticities as positive numbers. Mathematically, we take the absolute value of the result.

We will ignore this detail from now on, while remembering to interpret elasticities as positive numbers.

This means that, along the demand curve between point B and A, if the price changes by 1%, the quantity

demanded will change by 0.45%. A change in the price will result in a smaller percentage change in the

quantity demanded. For example, a 10% increasein the price will result in only a 4.5% decreasein quantity

demanded. A 10% decreasein the price will result in only a 4.5% increasein the quantity demanded. Price

elasticities of demand are negative numbers indicating that the demand curve is downward sloping, but we

read them as absolute values. The following Work It Out feature will walk you through calculating the price

elasticity of demand.

5.1 • Price Elasticity of Demand and Price Elasticity of Supply 115

WORK IT OUT

Finding the Price Elasticity of Demand
Calculate the price elasticity of demand using the data in Figure 5.2 for an increase in price from G to H. Has the

elasticity increased or decreased?

Step 1. We know that:

Step 2. From the Midpoint Formula we know that:

Step 3. So we can use the values provided in the figure in each equation:

Step 4. Then, we can use those values to determine the price elasticity of demand:

Therefore, the elasticity of demand from G to is H 1.47. The magnitude of the elasticity has increased (in

absolute value) as we moved up along the demand curve from points A to B. Recall that the elasticity between

these two points was 0.45. Demand was inelastic between points A and B and elastic between points G and H.

This shows us that price elasticity of demand changes at different points along a straight-line demand curve.

Calculating the Price Elasticity of Supply

Assume that an apartment rents for $650 per month and at that price the landlord rents 10,000 units as Figure

5.3 shows. When the price increases to $700 per month, the landlord supplies 13,000 units into the market. By

what percentage does apartment supply increase? What is the price sensitivity?

116 5 • Elasticity

FIGURE 5.3 Price Elasticity of Supply We calculate the price elasticity of supply as the percentage change in

quantity divided by the percentage change in price.

Using the Midpoint Method,

Again, as with the elasticity of demand, the elasticity of supply is not followed by any units. Elasticity is a ratio

of one percentage change to another percentage change—nothing more—and we read it as an absolute value. In

this case, a 1% rise in price causes an increase in quantity supplied of 3.5%. The greater than one elasticity of

supply means that the percentage change in quantity supplied will be greater than a one percent price change.

If you're starting to wonder if the concept of slope fits into this calculation, read the following Clear It Up box.

CLEAR IT UP

Is the elasticity the slope?
It is a common mistake to confuse the slope of either the supply or demand curve with its elasticity. The slope is the

rate of change in units along the curve, or the rise/run (change in y over the change in x). For example, in Figure 5.2,

at each point shown on the demand curve, price drops by $10 and the number of units demanded increases by 200

compared to the point to its left. The slope is –10/200 along the entire demand curve and does not change. The

price elasticity, however, changes along the curve. Elasticity between points A and B was 0.45 and increased to 1.47

between points G and H. Elasticity is the percentagechange, which is a different calculation from the slope and has

a different meaning.

When we are at the upper end of a demand curve, where price is high and the quantity demanded is low, a small

change in the quantity demanded, even in, say, one unit, is pretty big in percentage terms. A change in price of, say,

a dollar, is going to be much less important in percentage terms than it would have been at the bottom of the

5.2 • Polar Cases of Elasticity and Constant Elasticity 117

demand curve. Likewise, at the bottom of the demand curve, that one unit change when the quantity demanded is

high will be small as a percentage.

Thus, at one end of the demand curve, where we have a large percentage change in quantity demanded over a small

percentage change in price, the elasticity value would be high, or demand would be relatively elastic. Even with the

same change in the price and the same change in the quantity demanded, at the other end of the demand curve the

quantity is much higher, and the price is much lower, so the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller and

the percentage change in price is much higher. That means at the bottom of the curve we'd have a small numerator

over a large denominator, so the elasticity measure would be much lower, or inelastic.

As we move along the demand curve, the values for quantity and price go up or down, depending on which way we

are moving, so the percentages for, say, a $1 difference in price or a one unit difference in quantity, will change as

well, which means the ratios of those percentages and hence the elasticity will change.

5.2 Polar Cases of Elasticity and Constant Elasticity

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Differentiate between infinite and zero elasticity

• Analyze graphs in order to classify elasticity as constant unitary, infinite, or zero

There are two extreme cases of elasticity: when elasticity equals zero and when it is infinite. A third case of

interest is that of constant unitary elasticity. We will describe each case. Infinite elasticity or perfect elasticity

refers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded (Qd) or supplied (Qs) changes by an infinite

amount in response to any change in price at all. In both cases, the supply and the demand curve are

horizontal as Figure 5.4 shows. While perfectly elastic supply curves are for the most part unrealistic, goods

with readily available inputs and whose production can easily expand will feature highly elastic supply curves.

Examples include pizza, bread, books, and pencils. Similarly, perfectly elastic demand is an extreme example.

However, luxury goods, items that take a large share of individuals’ income, and goods with many substitutes

are likely to have highly elastic demand curves. Examples of such goods are Caribbean cruises and sports

vehicles.

FIGURE 5.4 Infinite Elasticity The horizontal lines show that an infinite quantity will be demanded or supplied at a

specific price. This illustrates the cases of a perfectly (or infinitely) elastic demand curve and supply curve. The

quantity supplied or demanded is extremely responsive to price changes, moving from zero for prices close to P to

infinite when prices reach P.

Zero elasticity or perfect inelasticity, as Figure 5.5 depicts, refers to the extreme case in which a percentage

change in price, no matter how large, results in zero change in quantity. While a perfectly inelastic supply is an

extreme example, goods with limited supply of inputs are likely to feature highly inelastic supply curves.

York City. Similarly, while perfectly inelastic demand is an extreme case, necessities with no close substitutes

are likely to have highly inelastic demand curves. This is the case of life-saving drugs and gasoline.

FIGURE 5.5 Zero Elasticity The vertical supply curve and vertical demand curve show that there will be zero

percentage change in quantity (a) demanded or (b) supplied, regardless of the price.

Constant unitary elasticity, in either a supply or demand curve, occurs when a price change of one percent

results in a quantity change of one percent. Figure 5.6 shows a demand curve with constant unit elasticity.

Using the midpoint method, you can calculate that between points A and B on the demand curve, the price

changes by 66.7% and quantity demanded also changes by 66.7%. Hence, the elasticity equals 1. Between

points B and C, price again changes by 66.7% as does quantity, while between points C and D the

corresponding percentage changes are again 66.7% for both price and quantity. In each case, then, the

percentage change in price equals the percentage change in quantity, and consequently elasticity equals 1.

Notice that in absolute value, the declines in price, as you step down the demand curve, are not identical.

Instead, the price falls by $8.00 from A to B, by a smaller amount of $4.00 from B to C, and by a still smaller

amount of $2.00 from C to D. As a result, a demand curve with constant unitary elasticity moves from a steeper

slope on the left and a flatter slope on the right—and a curved shape overall.

FIGURE 5.6 A Constant Unitary Elasticity Demand Curve A demand curve with constant unitary elasticity will be a

curved line. Notice how price and quantity demanded change by an identical percentage amount between each pair

of points on the demand curve.

Unlike the demand curve with unitary elasticity, the supply curve with unitary elasticity is represented by a

straight line, and that line goes through the origin. In each pair of points on the supply curve there is an equal

difference in quantity of 30. However, in percentage value, using the midpoint method, the steps are

decreasing as one moves from left to right, from 28.6% to 22.2% to 18.2%, because the quantity points in each

percentage calculation are getting increasingly larger, which expands the denominator in the elasticity

calculation of the percentage change in quantity.

Consider the price changes moving up the supply curve in Figure 5.7. From points D to E to F and to G on the

supply curve, each step of $1.50 is the same in absolute value. However, if we measure the price changes in

percentage change terms, using the midpoint method, they are also decreasing, from 28.6% to 22.2% to

18.2%, because the original price points in each percentage calculation are getting increasingly larger in value,

increasing the denominator in the calculation of the percentage change in price. Along the constant unitary

elasticity supply curve, the percentage quantity increases on the horizontal axis exactly match the percentage

price increases on the vertical axis—so this supply curve has a constant unitary elasticity at all points.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Analyze how price elasticities impact revenue

• Evaluate how elasticity can cause shifts in demand and supply

• Predict how the long-run and short-run impacts of elasticity affect equilibrium

• Explain how the elasticity of demand and supply determine the incidence of a tax on buyers and sellers

Studying elasticities is useful for a number of reasons, pricing being most important. Let’s explore how

elasticity relates to revenue and pricing, both in the long and short run. First, let’s look at the elasticities of

some common goods and services.

Table 5.2 shows a selection of demand elasticities for different goods and services drawn from a variety of

different studies by economists, listed in order of increasing elasticity.

TABLE 5.2 Some Selected Elasticities of Demand

Note that demand for necessities such as housing and electricity is inelastic, while items that are not

necessities such as restaurant meals are more price-sensitive. If the price of a restaurant meal increases by

10%, the quantity demanded will decrease by 22.7%. A 10% increase in the price of housing will cause only a

slight decrease of 1.2% in the quantity of housing demanded.

Read this article (http://openstax.org/l/Movietickets) for an example of price elasticity that may have affected

you.

Does Raising Price Bring in More Revenue?

Imagine that a band on tour is playing in an indoor arena with 15,000 seats. To keep this example simple,

assume that the band keeps all the money from ticket sales. Assume further that the band pays the costs for its

appearance, but that these costs, like travel, and setting up the stage, are the same regardless of how many

people are in the audience. Finally, assume that all the tickets have the same price. (The same insights apply if

ticket prices are more expensive for some seats than for others, but the calculations become more

complicated.) The band knows that it faces a downward-sloping demand curve; that is, if the band raises the

ticket price, it will sell fewer seats. How should the band set the ticket price to generate the most total revenue,

which in this example, because costs are fixed, will also mean the highest profits for the band? Should the band

sell more tickets at a lower price or fewer tickets at a higher price?

The key concept in thinking about collecting the most revenue is the price elasticity of demand. Total revenue

is price times the quantity of tickets sold. Imagine that the band starts off thinking about a certain price, which

will result in the sale of a certain quantity of tickets. The three possibilities are in Table 5.3. If demand is elastic

122 5 • Elasticity

at that price level, then the band should cut the price, because the percentage drop in price will result in an

even larger percentage increase in the quantity sold—thus raising total revenue. However, if demand is

inelastic at that original quantity level, then the band should raise the ticket price, because a certain

percentage increase in price will result in a smaller percentage decrease in the quantity sold—and total

revenue will rise. If demand has a unitary elasticity at that quantity, then an equal percentage change in

quantity will offset a moderate percentage change in the price—so the band will earn the same revenue

whether it (moderately) increases or decreases the ticket price.

If

Therefore . . .

A given % rise in P will be more than offset by a larger % fall in Q

so that total revenue (P × Q) falls.

A given % rise in P will be exactly offset by an equal % fall in Q

so that total revenue (P × Q) is unchanged.

A given % rise in P will cause a smaller % fall in Q so that total

revenue (P × Q) rises.

TABLE 5.3 Will the Band Earn More Revenue by Changing Ticket Prices?

What if the band keeps cutting price, because demand is elastic, until it reaches a level where it sells all 15,000

seats in the available arena? If demand remains elastic at that quantity, the band might try to move to a bigger

arena, so that it could slash ticket prices further and see a larger percentage increase in the quantity of tickets

sold. However, if the 15,000-seat arena is all that is available or if a larger arena would add substantially to

costs, then this option may not work.

Conversely, a few bands are so famous, or have such fanatical followings, that demand for tickets may be

inelastic right up to the point where the arena is full. These bands can, if they wish, keep raising the ticket

price. Ironically, some of the most popular bands could make more revenue by setting prices so high that the

arena is not full—but those who buy the tickets would have to pay very high prices. However, bands sometimes

choose to sell tickets for less than the absolute maximum they might be able to charge, often in the hope that

fans will feel happier and spend more on recordings, T-shirts, and other paraphernalia.

Can Businesses Pass Costs on to Consumers?

Most businesses face a day-to-day struggle to figure out ways to produce at a lower cost, as one pathway to their

goal of earning higher profits. However, in some cases, the price of a key input over which the firm has no

control may rise. For example, many chemical companies use petroleum as a key input, but they have no

control over the world market price for crude oil. Coffee shops use coffee as a key input, but they have no

control over the world market price of coffee. If the cost of a key input rises, can the firm pass those higher

costs along to consumers in the form of higher prices? Conversely, if new and less expensive ways of producing

are invented, can the firm keep the benefits in the form of higher profits, or will the market pressure them to

pass the gains along to consumers in the form of lower prices? The price elasticity of demand plays a key role

in answering these questions.

Imagine that as a consumer of legal pharmaceutical products, you read a newspaper story that a technological

breakthrough in the production of aspirin has occurred, so that every aspirin factory can now produce aspirin

more cheaply. What does this discovery mean to you? Figure 5.8 illustrates two possibilities. In Figure 5.8 (a),

the demand curve is highly inelastic. In this case, a technological breakthrough that shifts supply to the right,
from S0 to S1, so that the equilibrium shifts from E0 to E1, creates a substantially lower price for the product

Access for free at openstax.org

with relatively little impact on the quantity sold. In Figure 5.8 (b), the demand curve is highly elastic. In this

case, the technological breakthrough leads to a much greater quantity sold in the market at very close to the

original price. Consumers benefit more, in general, when the demand curve is more inelastic because the shift

in the supply results in a much lower price for consumers.

5.3 • Elasticity and Pricing 123

FIGURE 5.8 Passing along Cost Savings to Consumers Cost-saving gains cause supply to shift out to the right from
S0 to S1; that is, at any given price, firms will be willing to supply a greater quantity. If demand is inelastic, as in (a),
the result of this cost-saving technological improvement will be substantially lower prices. If demand is elastic, as in

(b), the result will be only slightly lower prices. Consumers benefit in either case, from a greater quantity at a lower

price, but the benefit is greater when demand is inelastic, as in (a).

Aspirin producers may find themselves in a nasty bind here. The situation in Figure 5.8, with extremely

inelastic demand, means that a new invention may cause the price to drop dramatically while quantity

changes little. As a result, the new production technology can lead to a drop in the revenue that firms earn

from aspirin sales. However, if strong competition exists between aspirin producers, each producer may have

little choice but to search for and implement any breakthrough that allows it to reduce production costs. After

all, if one firm decides not to implement such a cost-saving technology, other firms that do can drive them out

of business.

Since demand for food is generally inelastic, farmers may often face the situation in Figure 5.8 (a). That is, a

surge in production leads to a severe drop in price that can actually decrease the total revenue that farmers
receive. Conversely, poor weather or other conditions that cause a terrible year for farm production can

sharply raise prices so that the total revenue that the farmer receives increases. The Clear It Up box discusses

how these issues relate to coffee.

CLEAR IT UP

How do coffee prices fluctuate?
Coffee is an international crop. The top five coffee-exporting nations are Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, Indonesia, and

Ethiopia. In these nations and others, 20 million families depend on selling coffee beans as their main source of

income. These families are exposed to enormous risk, because the world price of coffee bounces up and down. For

example, in 1993, the world price of coffee was about 50 cents per pound. In 1995 it was four times as high, at $2

per pound. By 1997 it had fallen by half to $1.00 per pound. In 1998 it leaped back up to $2 per pound. By 2001 it

had fallen back to 46 cents a pound. By early 2011 it rose to about $2.31 per pound. By the end of 2012, the price

had fallen back to about $1.31 per pound. Since then, the price of coffee has continued to fluctuate.

124 5 • Elasticity

The reason for these price fluctuations lies in a combination of inelastic demand and shifts in supply. The elasticity

of coffee demand is only about 0.3; that is, a 10% rise in the price of coffee leads to a decline of about 3% in the

quantity of coffee consumed. When a major frost hit the Brazilian coffee crop in 1994, coffee supply shifted to the

left with an inelastic demand curve, leading to much higher prices. Conversely, when Vietnam entered the world

coffee market as a major producer in the late 1990s, the supply curve shifted out to the right. With a highly inelastic

demand curve, coffee prices fell dramatically. Figure 5.8 (a) illustrates this situation.

Elasticity also reveals whether firms can pass higher costs that they incur on to consumers. Addictive

substances, for which demand is inelastic, are products for which producers can pass higher costs on to

consumers. For example, the demand for cigarettes is relatively inelastic among regular smokers who are

somewhat addicted. Economic research suggests that increasing cigarette prices by 10% leads to about a 3%

reduction in the quantity of cigarettes that adults smoke, so the elasticity of demand for cigarettes is 0.3. If

society increases taxes on companies that produce cigarettes, the result will be, as in Figure 5.9 (a), that the
supply curve shifts from S0 to S1. However, as the equilibrium moves from E0 to E1, governments mainly pass
along these taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices. These higher taxes on cigarettes will raise tax

revenue for the government, but they will not much affect the quantity of smoking.

If the goal is to reduce the quantity of cigarettes demanded, we must achieve it by shifting this inelastic

demand back to the left, perhaps with public programs to discourage cigarette use or to help people to quit. For

example, anti-smoking advertising campaigns have shown some ability to reduce smoking. However, if
cigarette demand were more elastic, as in Figure 5.9 (b), then an increase in taxes that shifts supply from S0 to
S1 and equilibrium from E0 to E1 would reduce the quantity of cigarettes smoked substantially. Youth smoking
seems to be more elastic than adult smoking—that is, the quantity of youth smoking will fall by a greater

percentage than the quantity of adult smoking in response to a given percentage increase in price.

FIGURE 5.9 Passing along Higher Costs to Consumers Higher costs, like a higher tax on cigarette companies for

the example we gave in the text, lead supply to shift to the left. This shift is identical in (a) and (b). However, in (a),

where demand is inelastic, companies largely can pass the cost increase along to consumers in the form of higher

prices, without much of a decline in equilibrium quantity. In (b), demand is elastic, so the shift in supply results

primarily in a lower equilibrium quantity. Consumers do not benefit in either case, but in (a), they pay a higher price

for the same quantity, while in (b), they must buy a lower quantity (and presumably needing to shift their

consumption elsewhere).

5.3 • Elasticity and Pricing 125

Elasticity and Tax Incidence

The example of cigarette taxes demonstrated that because demand is inelastic, taxes are not effective at

reducing the equilibrium quantity of smoking, and they are mainly passed along to consumers in the form of

higher prices. The analysis, or manner, of how a tax burden is divided between consumers and producers is

called tax incidence. Typically, the tax incidence, or burden, falls both on the consumers and producers of the

taxed good. However, if one wants to predict which group will bear most of the burden, all one needs to do is

examine the elasticity of demand and supply. In the tobacco example, the tax burden falls on the most inelastic

side of the market.

If demand is more inelastic than supply, consumers bear most of the tax burden, and if supply is more

inelastic than demand, sellers bear most of the tax burden.

The intuition for this is simple. When the demand is inelastic, consumers are not very responsive to price

changes, and the quantity demanded reduces only modestly when the tax is introduced. In the case of

smoking, the demand is inelastic because consumers are addicted to the product. The government can then

pass the tax burden along to consumers in the form of higher prices, without much of a decline in the

equilibrium quantity.

Similarly, when a government introduces a tax in a market with an inelastic supply, such as, for example,

beachfront hotels, and sellers have no alternative than to accept lower prices for their business, taxes do not

greatly affect the equilibrium quantity. The tax burden now passes on to the sellers. If the supply was elastic

and sellers had the possibility of reorganizing their businesses to avoid supplying the taxed good, the tax

burden on the sellers would be much smaller. The tax would result in a much lower quantity sold instead of

lower prices received. Figure 5.10 illustrates this relationship between the tax incidence and elasticity of

demand and supply.

FIGURE 5.10 Elasticity and Tax Incidence An excise tax introduces a wedge between the price paid by consumers

(Pc) and the price received by producers (Pp). The vertical distance between Pc and Pp is the amount of the tax per

unit. Pe is the equilibrium price prior to introduction of the tax. (a) When the demand is more elastic than supply, the

tax incidence on consumers Pc – Pe is lower than the tax incidence on producers Pe – Pp. (b) When the supply is

more elastic than demand, the tax incidence on consumers Pc – Pe is larger than the tax incidence on producers Pe

– Pp. The more elastic the demand and supply curves, the lower the tax revenue.

In Figure 5.10 (a), the supply is inelastic and the demand is elastic, such as in the example of beachfront hotels.

While consumers may have other vacation choices, sellers can’t easily move their businesses. By introducing a

tax, the government essentially creates a wedge between the price paid by consumers Pc and the price

received by producers Pp. In other words, of the total price paid by consumers, part is retained by the sellers

126 5 • Elasticity

and part is paid to the government in the form of a tax. The distance between Pc and Pp is the tax rate. The new

market price is Pc, but sellers receive only Pp per unit sold, as they pay Pc-Pp to the government. Since we can

view a tax as raising the costs of production, this could also be represented by a leftward shift of the supply

curve, where the new supply curve would intercept the demand at the new quantity Qt. For simplicity, Figure

5.10 omits the shift in the supply curve.

The tax revenue is given by the shaded area, which we obtain by multiplying the tax per unit by the total

quantity sold Qt. The tax incidence on the consumers is given by the difference between the price paid Pc and

the initial equilibrium price Pe. The tax incidence on the sellers is given by the difference between the initial

equilibrium price Pe and the price they receive after the tax is introduced Pp. In Figure 5.10 (a), the tax burden

falls disproportionately on the sellers, and a larger proportion of the tax revenue (the shaded area) is due to the

resulting lower price received by the sellers than by the resulting higher prices paid by the buyers. Figure 5.10

(b) describes the example of the tobacco excise tax where the supply is more elastic than demand. The tax

incidence now falls disproportionately on consumers, as shown by the large difference between the price they

pay, Pc, and the initial equilibrium price, Pe. Sellers receive a lower price than before the tax, but this

difference is much smaller than the change in consumers’ price. From this analysis one can also predict

whether a tax is likely to create a large revenue or not. The more elastic the demand curve, the more likely that

consumers will reduce quantity instead of paying higher prices. The more elastic the supply curve, the more

likely that sellers will reduce the quantity sold, instead of taking lower prices. In a market where both the

demand and supply are very elastic, the imposition of an excise tax generates low revenue.

Some believe that excise taxes hurt mainly the specific industries they target. For example, the medical device

excise tax, which was implemented in 2013, has been controversial for it can delay industry profitability and

therefore hamper start-ups and medical innovation. The tax was repealed in late 2019. However, whether the

tax burden falls mostly on the medical device industry or on the patients depends simply on the elasticity of

demand and supply.

Long-Run vs. Short-Run Impact

Elasticities are often lower in the short run than in the long run. On the demand side of the market, it can

sometimes be difficult to change Qd in the short run, but easier in the long run. Consumption of energy is a

clear example. In the short run, it is not easy for a person to make substantial changes in energy consumption.

Maybe you can carpool to work sometimes or adjust your home thermostat by a few degrees if the cost of

energy rises, but that is about all. However, in the long run you can purchase a car that gets more miles to the

gallon, choose a job that is closer to where you live, buy more energy-efficient home appliances, or install more

insulation in your home. As a result, the elasticity of demand for energy is somewhat inelastic in the short run,

but much more elastic in the long run.

Figure 5.11 is an example, based roughly on historical experience, for the responsiveness of Qd to price

changes. In 1973, the price of crude oil was $12 per barrel and total consumption in the U.S. economy was 17

million barrels per day. That year, the nations who were members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting

Countries (OPEC) cut off oil exports to the United States for six months because the Arab members of OPEC

disagreed with the U.S. support for Israel. OPEC did not bring exports back to their earlier levels until 1975—a

policy that we can interpret as a shift of the supply curve to the left in the U.S. petroleum market. Figure 5.11

(a) and Figure 5.11 (b) show the same original equilibrium point and the same identical shift of a supply curve
to the left from S0 to S1.

Access for free at openstax.org

5.3 • Elasticity and Pricing 127

FIGURE 5.11 How a Shift in Supply Can Affect Price or Quantity The intersection (E0) between demand curve D and
supply curve S0 is the same in both (a) and (b). The shift of supply to the left from S0 to S1 is identical in both (a) and
(b). The new equilibrium (E1) has a higher price and a lower quantity than the original equilibrium (E0) in both (a) and
(b). However, the shape of the demand curve D is different in (a) and (b), being more elastic in (b) than in (a). As a

result, the shift in supply can result either in a new equilibrium with a much higher price and an only slightly smaller

quantity, as in (a), with more inelastic demand, or in a new equilibrium with only a small increase in price and a

relatively larger reduction in quantity, as in (b), with more elastic demand.

Figure 5.11 (a) shows inelastic demand for oil in the short run similar to that which existed for the United
States in 1973. In Figure 5.11 (a), the new equilibrium (E1) occurs at a price of $25 per barrel, roughly double
the price before the OPEC shock, and an equilibrium quantity of 16 million barrels per day. Figure 5.11 (b)

shows what the outcome would have been if the U.S. demand for oil had been more elastic, a result more likely
over the long term. This alternative equilibrium (E1) would have resulted in a smaller price increase to $14 per
barrel and larger reduction in equilibrium quantity to 13 million barrels per day. In 1983, for example, U.S.

petroleum consumption was 15.3 million barrels a day, which was lower than in 1973 or 1975. U.S. petroleum

consumption was down even though the U.S. economy was about one-fourth larger in 1983 than it had been in

1973. The primary reason for the lower quantity was that higher energy prices spurred conservation efforts,

and after a decade of home insulation, more fuel-efficient cars, more efficient appliances and machinery, and

other fuel-conserving choices, the demand curve for energy had become more elastic.

On the supply side of markets, producers of goods and services typically find it easier to expand production in

the long term of several years rather than in the short run of a few months. After all, in the short run it can be

costly or difficult to build a new factory, hire many new workers, or open new stores. However, over a few years,

all of these are possible.

In most markets for goods and services, prices bounce up and down more than quantities in the short run, but

quantities often move more than prices in the long run. The underlying reason for this pattern is that supply

and demand are often inelastic in the short run, so that shifts in either demand or supply can cause a relatively

greater change in prices. However, since supply and demand are more elastic in the long run, the long-run

movements in prices are more muted, while quantity adjusts more easily in the long run.

128 5 • Elasticity

5.4 Elasticity in Areas Other Than Price

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Calculate the income elasticity of demand and the cross-price elasticity of demand

• Calculate the elasticity in labor and financial capital markets through an understanding of the elasticity of

labor supply and the elasticity of savings

• Apply concepts of price elasticity to real-world situations

The basic idea of elasticity—how a percentage change in one variable causes a percentage change in another

variable—does not just apply to the responsiveness of quantity supplied and quantity demanded to changes in

the price of a product. Recall that quantity demanded (Qd) depends on income, tastes and preferences, the

prices of related goods, and so on, as well as price. Similarly, quantity supplied (Qs) depends on factors such as

the cost of production, as well as price. We can measure elasticity for any determinant of quantity supplied and

quantity demanded, not just the price.

Income Elasticity of Demand

The income elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage
change in income.

For most products, most of the time, the income elasticity of demand is positive: that is, a rise in income will

cause an increase in the quantity demanded. This pattern is common enough that we refer to these goods as

normal goods. However, for a few goods, an increase in income means that one might purchase less of the

good. For example, those with a higher income might buy fewer hamburgers, because they are buying more

steak instead, or those with a higher income might buy less cheap wine and more imported beer. When the

income elasticity of demand is negative, we call the good an inferior good.

We introduced the concepts of normal and inferior goods in Demand and Supply. A higher level of income

causes a demand curve to shift to the right for a normal good, which means that the income elasticity of

demand is positive. How far the demand shifts depends on the income elasticity of demand. A higher income

elasticity means a larger shift. However, for an inferior good, that is, when the income elasticity of demand is

negative, a higher level of income would cause the demand curve for that good to shift to the left. Again, how

much it shifts depends on how large the (negative) income elasticity is.

Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand

A change in the price of one good can shift the quantity demanded for another good. If the two goods are

complements, like bread and peanut butter, then a drop in the price of one good will lead to an increase in the

quantity demanded of the other good. However, if the two goods are substitutes, like plane tickets and train

tickets, then a drop in the price of one good will cause people to substitute toward that good, and to reduce

consumption of the other good. Cheaper plane tickets lead to fewer train tickets, and vice versa.

The cross-price elasticity of demand puts some meat on the bones of these ideas. The term “cross-price”

refers to the idea that the price of one good is affecting the quantity demanded of a different good. Specifically,

the cross-price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity of good A that is demanded as a

result of a percentage change in the price of good B.

Substitute goods have positive cross-price elasticities of demand: if good A is a substitute for good B, like coffee

and tea, then a higher price for B will mean a greater quantity consumed of A. Complement goods have

negative cross-price elasticities: if good A is a complement for good B, like coffee and sugar, then a higher price

Access for free at openstax.org

5.4 • Elasticity in Areas Other Than Price 129

for B will mean a lower quantity consumed of A.

Elasticity in Labor and Financial Capital Markets

The concept of elasticity applies to any market, not just markets for goods and services. In the labor market,

for example, the wage elasticity of labor supply—that is, the percentage change in hours worked divided by

the percentage change in wages—will reflect the shape of the labor supply curve. Specifically:

The wage elasticity of labor supply for teenage workers is generally fairly elastic: that is, a certain percentage

change in wages will lead to a larger percentage change in the quantity of hours worked. Conversely, the wage

elasticity of labor supply for adult workers in their thirties and forties is fairly inelastic. When wages move up

or down by a certain percentage amount, the quantity of hours that adults in their prime earning years are

willing to supply changes but by a lesser percentage amount.

In markets for financial capital, the elasticity of savings—that is, the percentage change in the quantity of

savings divided by the percentage change in interest rates—will describe the shape of the supply curve for

financial capital. That is:

Sometimes laws are proposed that seek to increase the quantity of savings by offering tax breaks so that the

return on savings is higher. Such a policy will have a comparatively large impact on increasing the quantity

saved if the supply curve for financial capital is elastic, because then a given percentage increase in the return

to savings will cause a higher percentage increase in the quantity of savings. However, if the supply curve for

financial capital is highly inelastic, then a percentage increase in the return to savings will cause only a small

increase in the quantity of savings. The evidence on the supply curve of financial capital is controversial but, at

least in the short run, the elasticity of savings with respect to the interest rate appears fairly inelastic.

Expanding the Concept of Elasticity

The elasticity concept does not even need to relate to a typical supply or demand curve at all. For example,

imagine that you are studying whether the Internal Revenue Service should spend more money on auditing tax

returns. We can frame the question in terms of the elasticity of tax collections with respect to spending on tax

enforcement; that is, what is the percentage change in tax collections derived from a given percentage change

in spending on tax enforcement?

With all of the elasticity concepts that we have just described, some of which are in Table 5.4, the possibility of

confusion arises. When you hear the phrases “elasticity of demand” or “elasticity of supply,” they refer to the
elasticity with respect to price. Sometimes, either to be extremely clear or because economists are discussing a

wide variety of elasticities, we will call the elasticity of demand or the demand elasticity the price elasticity of

demand or the “elasticity of demand with respect to price.” Similarly, economists sometimes use the term

elasticity of supply or the supply elasticity, to avoid any possibility of confusion, the price elasticity of supply or

“the elasticity of supply with respect to price.” However, in whatever context, the idea of elasticity always refers

to percentage change in one variable, almost always a price or money variable, and how it causes a percentage

change in another variable, typically a quantity variable of some kind.

That Will Be How Much?
How did the 60% price increase in 2011 end up for Netflix? It has been a very bumpy ride.

Before the price increase, there were about 24.6 million U.S. subscribers. After the price increase, 810,000

infuriated U.S. consumers canceled their Netflix subscriptions, dropping the total number of subscribers to 23.79

million. Fast forward to June 2013, when there were 36 million streaming Netflix subscribers in the United States.

This was an increase of 11.4 million subscribers since the price increase—an average per quarter growth of about

1.6 million. This growth is less than the 2 million per quarter increases Netflix experienced in the fourth quarter of

2010 and the first quarter of 2011.

During the first year after the price increase, the firm’s stock price (a measure of future expectations for the firm) fell

from about $33.60 per share per share to just under $7.80. By the end of 2016, however, the stock price was at

$123 per share. By the end of 2021, the stock price was just over $600 per share, and Netflix had more than 214

million subscribers in fifty countries.

What happened? Obviously, Netflix company officials understood the law of demand. Company officials reported,

when announcing the price increase, this could result in the loss of about 600,000 existing subscribers. Using the

elasticity of demand formula, it is easy to see company officials expected an inelastic response:

In addition, Netflix officials had anticipated the price increase would have little impact on attracting new customers.

Netflix anticipated adding up to 1.29 million new subscribers in the third quarter of 2011. It is true this was slower

growth than the firm had experienced—about 2 million per quarter.

Why was the estimate of customers leaving so far off? In the more than two decades since Netflix had been

founded, there was an increase in the number of close, but not perfect, substitutes. Consumers now had choices

ranging from Vudu, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Redbox, to retail stores. Jaime Weinman reported in Maclean’sthat

Redbox kiosks are “a five-minute drive for less from 68 percent of Americans, and it seems that many people still

find a five-minute drive more convenient than loading up a movie online.” It seems that in 2012, many consumers

still preferred a physical DVD disk over streaming video.

What missteps did the Netflix management make? In addition to misjudging the elasticity of demand, by failing to

account for close substitutes, it seems they may have also misjudged customers’ preferences and tastes. However,

the very substantial increase over time in the number of Netflix subscribers suggests that the preference for

streaming video may well have overtaken the preference for physical DVD disks. Netflix, the source of numerous late

night talk show laughs and jabs in 2011, may yet have the last laugh.

Key Concepts and Summary

5.1 Price Elasticity of Demand and Price Elasticity of Supply

Price elasticity measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded or supplied of a good to a change in its

price. We compute it as the percentage change in quantity demanded (or supplied) divided by the percentage

change in price. We can describe elasticity as elastic (or very responsive), unit elastic, or inelastic (not very

responsive). Elastic demand or supply curves indicate that quantity demanded or supplied respond to price

changes in a greater than proportional manner. An inelastic demand or supply curve is one where a given

percentage change in price will cause a smaller percentage change in quantity demanded or supplied. A
unitary elasticity means that a given percentage change in price leads to an equal percentage change in

quantity demanded or supplied.

5.2 Polar Cases of Elasticity and Constant Elasticity

Infinite or perfect elasticity refers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded or supplied

Access for free at openstax.org

5 • Self-Check Questions 133

changes by an infinite amount in response to any change in price at all. Zero elasticity refers to the extreme

case in which a percentage change in price, no matter how large, results in zero change in quantity. Constant

unitary elasticity in either a supply or demand curve refers to a situation where a price change of one percent

results in a quantity change of one percent.

5.3 Elasticity and Pricing

In the market for goods and services, quantity supplied and quantity demanded are often relatively slow to

react to changes in price in the short run, but react more substantially in the long run. As a result, demand and

supply often (but not always) tend to be relatively inelastic in the short run and relatively elastic in the long

run. A tax incidence depends on the relative price elasticity of supply and demand. When supply is more

elastic than demand, buyers bear most of the tax burden, and when demand is more elastic than supply,

producers bear most of the cost of the tax. Tax revenue is larger the more inelastic the demand and supply are.

5.4 Elasticity in Areas Other Than Price

Elasticity is a general term, that reflects responsiveness. It refers to the change of one variable divided by the

percentage change of a related variable that we can apply to many economic connections. For instance, the

income elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change
in income. The cross-price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good

divided by the percentage change in the price of another good. Elasticity applies in labor markets and financial

capital markets just as it does in markets for goods and services. The wage elasticity of labor supply is the

percentage change in the quantity of hours supplied divided by the percentage change in the wage. The

elasticity of savings with respect to interest rates is the percentage change in the quantity of savings divided by

the percentage change in interest rates.

FIGURE 6.1 The Great Depression At times, such as when many people having trouble making ends meet, it is

easy to tell how the economy is doing. This photograph shows people lined up during the Great Depression, waiting

Introduction to the Macroeconomic Perspective

BRING IT HOME

How is the Economy Doing? How Does One Tell?
The 1990s were boom years for the U.S. economy. Beginning in the late 2000s, from 2007 to 2014, economic

performance in the U.S. was poor. The economy experienced another period of strong growth between 2014 and

2019, before COVID-19 rocked the world economy in March and April of 2020. What causes the economy to expand

or contract? Why do businesses fail when they are making all the right decisions? Why do workers lose their jobs

when they are hardworking and productive? Are bad economic times a failure of the market system? Are they a

138 6 • The Macroeconomic Perspective

failure of the government? These are all questions of macroeconomics, which we will begin to address in this

chapter. We will not be able to answer all of these questions here, but we will start with the basics: How is the

economy doing? How can we tell?

The macro economy includes all buying and selling, all production and consumption; everything that goes on in

every market in the economy. How can we get a handle on that? The answer begins more than 80 years ago, during

the Great Depression. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his economic advisers knew things were bad—but how

could they express and measure just how bad it was? An economist named Simon Kuznets, who later won the Nobel

Prize for his work, came up with a way to track what the entire economy is producing. In this chapter, you will learn

how the government constructs GDP, how we use it, and why it is so important.

Macroeconomics focuses on the economy as a whole (or on whole economies as they interact). What causes

recessions? What makes unemployment stay high when recessions are supposed to be over? Why do some

countries grow faster than others? Why do some countries have higher standards of living than others? These

are all questions that macroeconomics addresses. Macroeconomics involves adding up the economic activity

of all households and all businesses in all markets to obtain the overall demand and supply in the economy.

However, when we do that, something curious happens. It is not unusual that what results at the macro level is
different from the sum of the microeconomic parts. What seems sensible from a microeconomic point of view

can have unexpected or counterproductive results at the macroeconomic level. Imagine that you are sitting at

an event with a large audience, like a live concert or a basketball game. A few people decide that they want a

better view, and so they stand up. However, when these people stand up, they block the view for other people,

and the others need to stand up as well if they wish to see. Eventually, nearly everyone is standing up, and as a

result, no one can see much better than before. The rational decision of some individuals at the micro level—to

stand up for a better view—ended up as self-defeating at the macro level. This is not macroeconomics, but it is

an apt analogy.

Macroeconomics is a rather massive subject. How are we going to tackle it? Figure 6.2 illustrates the structure

we will use. We will study macroeconomics from three different perspectives:

1. What are the macroeconomic goals? (Macroeconomics as a discipline does not have goals, but we do have

goals for the macro economy.)

2. What are the frameworks economists can use to analyze the macroeconomy?

3. Finally, what are the policy tools governments can use to manage the macroeconomy?

FIGURE 6.2 Macroeconomic Goals, Framework, and Policies This chart shows what macroeconomics is about. The

box on the left indicates a consensus of what are the most important goals for the macro economy, the middle box

lists the frameworks economists use to analyze macroeconomic changes (such as inflation or recession), and the

box on the right indicates the two tools the federal government uses to influence the macro economy.

Goals

In thinking about the macroeconomy's overall health, it is useful to consider three primary goals: economic

growth, low unemployment, and low inflation.

• Economic growth ultimately determines the prevailing standard of living in a country. Economists

measure growth by the percentage change in real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product. A growth

6.1 • Measuring the Size of the Economy: Gross Domestic Product 139

rate of more than 3% is considered good.

• Unemployment, as measured by the unemployment rate, is the percentage of people in the labor force

who do not have a job. When people lack jobs, the economy is wasting a precious resource-labor, and the

result is lower goods and services produced. Unemployment, however, is more than a statistic—it

represents people’s livelihoods. While measured unemployment is unlikely to ever be zero, economists

consider a measured unemployment rate of 5% or less low (good).

•

Inflation is a sustained increase in the overall level of prices, and is measured by the consumer price

index. If many people face a situation where the prices that they pay for food, shelter, and healthcare are

rising much faster than the wages they receive for their labor, there will be widespread unhappiness as

their standard of living declines. For that reason, low inflation—an inflation rate of 1–2%—is a major goal.

Frameworks

As you learn in the micro part of this book, principal tools that economists use are theories and models (see

Welcome to Economics! for more on this). In microeconomics, we used the theories of supply and demand. In

macroeconomics, we use the theories of aggregate demand (AD) and aggregate supply (AS). This book presents

two perspectives on macroeconomics: the Neoclassical perspective and the Keynesian perspective, each of
which has its own version of AD and AS. Between the two perspectives, you will obtain a good understanding of
what drives the macroeconomy.

Policy Tools

National governments have two tools for influencing the macroeconomy. The first is monetary policy, which

involves managing the money supply and interest rates. The second is fiscal policy, which involves changes in

government spending/purchases and taxes.

We will explain each of the items in Figure 6.2 in detail in one or more other chapters. As you learn these

things, you will discover that the goals and the policy tools are in the news almost every day.

6.1 Measuring the Size of the Economy: Gross Domestic Product

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•

Identify the components of GDP on the demand side and on the supply side

• Evaluate how economists measure gross domestic product (GDP)

• Contrast and calculate GDP, net exports, and net national product

Macroeconomics is an empirical subject, so the first step toward understanding it is to measure the economy.

How large is the U.S. economy? Economists typically measure the size of a nation’s overall economy by its
gross domestic product (GDP), which is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country in

a given year. Measuring GDP involves counting the production of millions of different goods and

services—smart phones, cars, music downloads, computers, steel, bananas, college educations, and all other

new goods and services that a country produced in the current year—and summing them into a total dollar

value. This task is straightforward: take the quantity of everything produced, multiply it by the price at which

each product sold, and add up the total. In 2020, the U.S. GDP totaled $20.9 trillion, the largest GDP in the

world.

Each of the market transactions that enter into GDP must involve both a buyer and a seller. We can measure an

economy's GDP either by the total dollar value of what consumers purchase in the economy, or by the total

dollar value of what is the country produces. There is even a third way, as we will explain later.

GDP Measured by Components of Demand

Who buys all of this production? We can divide this demand into four main parts: consumer spending

(consumption), business spending (investment), government spending on goods and services, and spending

140 6 • The Macroeconomic Perspective

on net exports. (See the following Clear It Up feature to understand what we mean by investment.) Table 6.1

shows how these four components added up to the GDP in 2020, Figure 6.4 (a) shows the levels of

consumption, investment, and government purchases over time, expressed as a percentage of GDP, while

Figure 6.4 (b) shows the levels of exports and imports as a percentage of GDP over time. A few patterns about

each of these components are worth noticing. Table 6.1 shows the components of GDP from the demand side.

CLEAR IT UP

What does the word “investment” mean?
What do economists mean by investment, or business spending? In calculating GDP, investment does not refer to

purchasing stocks and bonds or trading financial assets. It refers to purchasing new capital goods, that is, new

commercial real estate (such as buildings, factories, and stores) and equipment, residential housing construction,

and inventories. Inventories that manufacturers produce this year are included in this year’s GDP—even if they are

not yet sold. From the accountant’s perspective, it is as if the firm invested in its own inventories. Business

investment in 2020 was $3.6 trillion, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

6.1 • Measuring the Size of the Economy: Gross Domestic Product 141

FIGURE 6.4 Components of GDP on the Demand Side (a) Consumption is about two-thirds of GDP, and it has been

on a slight upward trend over time. Business investment hovers around 15% of GDP, but it fluctuates more than

consumption. Government spending on goods and services is slightly under 20% of GDP and has declined modestly

over time. (b) Exports are added to total demand for goods and services, while imports are subtracted from total

demand. If exports exceed imports, as in most of the 1960s and 1970s in the U.S. economy, a trade surplus exists.

If imports exceed exports, as in recent years, then a trade deficit exists. (Source: http://bea.gov/iTable/

index_nipa.cfm, Table 1.1.10)

Consumption expenditure by households is the largest component of GDP, accounting for about two-thirds of

the GDP in any year. This tells us that consumers’ spending decisions are a major driver of the economy.

However, consumer spending is a gentle elephant: when viewed over time, it does not jump around too much,

and has increased modestly from about 60% of GDP in the 1960s and 1970s.

Investment expenditure refers to purchases of physical plant and equipment, primarily by businesses. If

Starbucks builds a new store, or Amazon buys robots, they count these expenditures under business

investment. Investment demand is far smaller than consumption demand, typically accounting for only about

15–18% of GDP, but it is very important for the economy because this is where jobs are created. However, it

fluctuates more noticeably than consumption. Business investment is volatile. New technology or a new

product can spur business investment, but then confidence can drop and business investment can pull back

sharply.

If you have noticed any of the infrastructure projects (new bridges, highways, airports) launched during the

2009 recession, or if you received a stimulus check during the pandemic-induced recession of 2020–2021, you

have seen how important government spending can be for the economy. Government expenditure in the

United States is close to 20% of GDP, and includes spending by all three levels of government: federal, state,

and local. The only part of government spending counted in demand is government purchases of goods or

services produced in the economy. Examples include the government buying a new fighter jet for the Air Force

(federal government spending), building a new highway (state government spending), or a new school (local

government spending). A significant portion of government budgets consists of transfer payments, like

unemployment benefits, veteran’s benefits, and Social Security payments to retirees. The government

excludes these payments from GDP because it does not receive a new good or service in return or exchange.

Instead they are transfers of income from taxpayers to others. If you are curious about the awesome

undertaking of adding up GDP, read the following Clear It Up feature.

142 6 • The Macroeconomic Perspective

CLEAR IT UP

How do statisticians measure GDP?
Government economists at the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), within the U.S. Department of Commerce, piece

together estimates of GDP from a variety of sources.

Once every five years, in the second and seventh year of each decade, the Bureau of the Census carries out a

detailed census of businesses throughout the United States. In between, the Census Bureau carries out a monthly

survey of retail sales. The government adjusts these figures with foreign trade data to account for exports that are

produced in the United States and sold abroad and for imports that are produced abroad and sold here. Once every

ten years, the Census Bureau conducts a comprehensive survey of housing and residential finance. Together, these

sources provide the main basis for figuring out what is produced for consumers.

For investment, the Census Bureau carries out a monthly survey of construction and an annual survey of

expenditures on physical capital equipment.

For what the federal government purchases, the statisticians rely on the U.S. Department of the Treasury. An annual

Census of Governments gathers information on state and local governments. Because the government spends a
considerable amount at all levels hiring people to provide services, it also tracks a large portion of spending through

payroll records that state governments and the Social Security Administration collect.

With regard to foreign trade, the Census Bureau compiles a monthly record of all import and export documents.

Additional surveys cover transportation and travel, and make adjustments for financial services that are produced in

the United States for foreign customers.

Many other sources contribute to GDP estimates. Information on energy comes from the U.S. Department of

Transportation and Department of Energy. The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality collects information on

healthcare. Surveys of landlords find out about rental income. The Department of Agriculture collects statistics on

farming.

All these bits and pieces of information arrive in different forms, at different time intervals. The BEA melds them

together to produce GDP estimates on a quarterly basis (every three months). The BEA then "annualizes" these

numbers by multiplying by four. As more information comes in, the BEA updates and revises these estimates. BEA

releases the GDP “advance” estimate for a certain quarter one month after a quarter. The “preliminary” estimate

comes out one month after that. The BEA publishes the “final” estimate one month later, but it is not actually final.

In July, the BEA releases roughly updated estimates for the previous calendar year. Then, once every five years,

after it has processed all the results of the latest detailed five-year business census, the BEA revises all of the past

GDP estimates according to the newest methods and data, going all the way back to 1929.

When thinking about the demand for domestically produced goods in a global economy, it is important to

count spending on exports—domestically produced goods that a country sells abroad. Similarly, we must also

subtract spending on imports—goods that a country produces in other countries that residents of this country

purchase. The GDP net export component is equal to the dollar value of exports (X) minus the dollar value of

imports (M), (X – M). We call the gap between exports and imports the trade balance. If a country’s exports are

larger than its imports, then a country has a trade surplus. In the United States, exports typically exceeded

imports in the 1960s and 1970s, as Figure 6.4(b) shows.

Since the early 1980s, imports have typically exceeded exports, and so the United States has experienced a

trade deficit in most years. The trade deficit grew quite large in the late 1990s and in the mid-2000s. Figure

6.4 (b) also shows that imports and exports have both risen substantially in recent decades, even after the

declines during the Great Recession between 2008 and 2009. As we noted before, if exports and imports are

equal, foreign trade has no effect on total GDP. However, even if exports and imports are balanced overall,

foreign trade might still have powerful effects on particular industries and workers by causing nations to shift

workers and physical capital investment toward one industry rather than another.

Based on these four components of demand, we can measure GDP as:

Understanding how to measure GDP is important for analyzing connections in the macro economy and for

thinking about macroeconomic policy tools.

GDP Measured by What is Produced

Everything that we purchase somebody must first produce. Table 6.2 breaks down what a country produces

into five categories: durable goods, nondurable goods, services, structures, and the change in inventories.

Before going into detail about these categories, notice that total GDP measured according to what is produced

is exactly the same as the GDP measured by looking at the five components of demand. Figure 6.5 provides a

visual representation of this information.

144 6 • The Macroeconomic Perspective

FIGURE 6.5 Percentage of Components of GDP on the Production Side Services make up over 60 percent of the

production side components of GDP in the United States.

Since every market transaction must have both a buyer and a seller, GDP must be the same whether measured
by what is demanded or by what is produced. Figure 6.6 shows these components of what is produced,
expressed as a percentage of GDP, since 1950.

FIGURE 6.6 Types of Production Services are the largest single component of total supply, representing over 60

percent of GDP, up from about 45 percent in the early 1950s. Durable and nondurable goods constitute the

manufacturing sector, and they have declined from 40 percent of GDP in 1950 to about 30 percent in 2016.

Nondurable goods used to be larger than durable goods, but in recent years, nondurable goods have been dropping

6.1 • Measuring the Size of the Economy: Gross Domestic Product 145

to below the share of durable goods, which is less than 20% of GDP. Structures hover around 10% of GDP. We do

not show here the change in inventories, the final component of aggregate supply. It is typically less than 1% of

GDP.

In thinking about what is produced in the economy, many non-economists immediately focus on solid, long-

lasting goods, like cars and computers. By far the largest part of GDP, however, is services. Moreover, services

have been a growing share of GDP over time. A detailed breakdown of the leading service industries would

include healthcare, education, and legal and financial services. It has been decades since most of the U.S.

economy involved making solid objects. Instead, the most common jobs in a modern economy involve a

worker looking at pieces of paper or a computer screen; meeting with co-workers, customers, or suppliers; or

making phone calls.

Even within the overall category of goods, long-lasting durable goods like cars and refrigerators are about the

same share of the economy as short-lived nondurable goods like food and clothing. The category of structures

includes everything from homes, to office buildings, shopping malls, and factories. Inventories is a small

category that refers to the goods that one business has produced but has not yet sold to consumers, and are

still sitting in warehouses and on shelves. The amount of inventories sitting on shelves tends to decline if
business is better than expected, or to rise if business is worse than expected.

Another Way to Measure GDP: The National Income Approach

GDP is a measure of what is produced in a nation. The primary way GDP is estimated is with the Expenditure

Approach we discussed above, but there is another way. Everything a firm produces, when sold, becomes

revenues to the firm. Businesses use revenues to pay their bills: Wages and salaries for labor, interest and

dividends for capital, rent for land, profit to the entrepreneur, etc. So adding up all the income produced in a

year provides a second way of measuring GDP. This is why the terms GDP and national income are sometimes

used interchangeably. The total value of a nation’s output is equal to the total value of a nation’s income.

The Problem of Double Counting

We define GDP as the current value of all final goods and services produced in a nation in a year. What are final

goods? They are goods at the furthest stage of production at the end of a year. Statisticians who calculate GDP

must avoid the mistake of double counting, in which they count output more than once as it travels through

the production stages. For example, imagine what would happen if government statisticians first counted the

value of tires that a tire manufacturer produces, and then counted the value of a new truck that an automaker

sold that contains those tires. In this example, the statisticians would have counted the value of the tires twice-

because the truck's price includes the value of the tires.

To avoid this problem, which would overstate the size of the economy considerably, government statisticians
count just the value of final goods and services in the chain of production that are sold for consumption,

investment, government, and trade purposes. Statisticians exclude intermediate goods, which are goods that

go into producing other goods, from GDP calculations. From the example above, they will only count the Ford

truck's value. The value of what businesses provide to other businesses is captured in the final products at the

end of the production chain.

The concept of GDP is fairly straightforward: it is just the dollar value of all final goods and services produced

in the economy in a year. In our decentralized, market-oriented economy, actually calculating the more than

$21 trillion-dollar U.S. GDP—along with how it is changing every few months—is a full-time job for a brigade of

government statisticians.

TABLE 6.3 Counting GDP

Notice the items that are not counted into GDP, as Table 6.3 outlines. The sales of used goods are not included

because they were produced in a previous year and are part of that year’s GDP. The entire underground

economy of services paid “under the table” and illegal sales should be counted, but is not, because it is

impossible to track these sales. In Friedrich Schneider's recent study of shadow economies, he estimated the

underground economy in the United States to be 6.6% of GDP, or close to $2 trillion dollars in 2013 alone.
Transfer payments, such as payment by the government to individuals, are not included, because they do not

represent production. Also, production of some goods—such as home production as when you make your

breakfast—is not counted because these goods are not sold in the marketplace.

Other Ways to Measure the Economy

Besides GDP, there are several different but closely related ways of measuring the size of the economy. We

mentioned above that we can think of GDP as total production and as total purchases. We can also think of it as

total income since anything one produces and sells yields income.

One of the closest cousins of GDP is the gross national product (GNP). GDP includes only what country

produces within its borders. GNP adds what domestic businesses and labor abroad produces, and subtracts

any payments that foreign labor and businesses located in the United States send home to other countries. In

other words, GNP is based more on what a country's citizens and firms produce, wherever they are located,

and GDP is based on what happens within a certain county's geographic boundaries. For the United States, the

gap between GDP and GNP is relatively small; in recent years, only about 0.2%. For small nations, which may

have a substantial share of their population working abroad and sending money back home, the difference can

be substantial.

We calculate net national product (NNP) by taking GNP and then subtracting the value of how much physical

capital is worn out, or reduced in value because of aging, over the course of a year. The process by which

capital ages and loses value is called depreciation. We can further subdivide NNP into national income, which

includes all income to businesses and individuals, and personal income, which includes only income to

people.

The gross national income (GNI) includes the value of all goods and services produced by people from a

country—whether in the country or not. Unlike the other methods, GNI essentially measures the wealth of a

nation because it focuses on income, not output. As you will see in the discussion regarding global economic

diversity, the World Bank now uses GNI to classify nations according to economic status.

For practical purposes, it is not vital to memorize these definitions. However, it is important to be aware that

these differences exist and to know what statistic you are examining, so that you do not accidentally compare,

say, GDP in one year or for one country with GNP or NNP in another year or another country. To get an idea of

6.2 Adjusting Nominal Values to Real Values

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Contrast nominal GDP and real GDP

• Explain GDP deflator

• Calculate real GDP based on nominal GDP values

When examining economic statistics, there is a crucial distinction worth emphasizing. The distinction is

between nominal and real measurements, which refer to whether or not inflation has distorted a given

statistic. Looking at economic statistics without considering inflation is like looking through a pair of

binoculars and trying to guess how close something is: unless you know how strong the lenses are, you cannot

guess the distance very accurately. Similarly, if you do not know the inflation rate, it is difficult to figure out if a

rise in GDP is due mainly to a rise in the overall level of prices or to a rise in quantities of goods produced. The

nominal value of any economic statistic means that we measure the statistic in terms of actual prices that

exist at the time. The real value refers to the same statistic after it has been adjusted for inflation. Generally, it

is the real value that is more important.

Converting Nominal to Real GDP

Table 6.5 shows U.S. GDP at five-year intervals since 1960 in nominal dollars; that is, GDP measured using the

actual market prices prevailing in each stated year. Figure 6.7 also reflects this data in a graph.

6.2 • Adjusting Nominal Values to Real Values 149

FIGURE 6.7 U.S. Nominal GDP, 1960–2020 Nominal GDP values have risen exponentially from 1960 through 2020,

according to the BEA.

If an unwary analyst compared nominal GDP in 1960 to nominal GDP in 2010, it might appear that national

output had risen by a factor of more than 38 over this time (that is, GDP of $20.9 trillion in 2020 divided by

GDP of $543 billion in 1960 = 38). This conclusion would be highly misleading. Recall that we define nominal

GDP as the quantity of every final good or service produced multiplied by the price at which it was sold,

summed up for all goods and services. In order to see how much production has actually increased, we need to

extract the effects of higher prices on nominal GDP. We can easily accomplish this using the GDP deflator.

The GDP deflator is a price index measuring the average prices of all final goods and services included in the

economy. We explore price indices in detail and how we compute them in Inflation, but this definition will do

in the context of this chapter. Table 6.5 provides the GDP deflator data and Figure 6.8 shows it graphically.

FIGURE 6.8 U.S. GDP Deflator, 1960–2020 Much like nominal GDP, the GDP deflator has risen exponentially from

1960 through 2010. (Source: BEA https://apps.bea.gov/itable/index.cfm, Table 1.1.9)

Figure 6.8 shows that the price level has risen dramatically since 1960. The price level in 2020 was seven times

higher than in 1960 (the deflator for 2020 was 113 versus a level of 17 in 1960). Clearly, much of the growth in

nominal GDP was due to inflation, not an actual change in the quantity of goods and services produced, in
other words, not in real GDP. Recall that nominal GDP can rise for two reasons: an increase in output, and/or an

increase in prices. What is needed is to extract the increase in prices from nominal GDP so as to measure only

changes in output. After all, the dollars used to measure nominal GDP in 1960 are worth more than the inflated

dollars of 2020—and the price index tells exactly how much more. This adjustment is easy to do if you

150 6 • The Macroeconomic Perspective

understand that nominal measurements are in value terms, where

Let’s look at an example at the micro level. Suppose the t-shirt company, Coolshirts, sells 10 t-shirts at a price

of $9 each.

Then,

In other words, when we compute “real” measurements we are trying to obtain actual quantities, in this case,

10 t-shirts.

With GDP, it is just a tiny bit more complicated. We start with the same formula as above:

For reasons that we will explain in more detail below, mathematically, a price index is a two-digit decimal

number like 1.00 or 0.85 or 1.25. Because some people have trouble working with decimals, when the price

index is published, it has traditionally been multiplied by 100 to get integer numbers like 100, 85, or 125. What

this means is that when we “deflate” nominal figures to get real figures (by dividing the nominal by the price

index). We also need to remember to divide the published price index by 100 to make the math work. Thus, the

formula becomes:

Now read the following Work It Out feature for more practice calculating real GDP.

Computing GDP
It is possible to use the data in Table 6.5 to compute real GDP.

Step 1. Look at Table 6.5, to see that, in 1960, nominal GDP was $543.3 billion and the price index (GDP deflator)

was 19.0.

Step 2. To calculate the real GDP in 1960, use the formula:

WORK IT OUT

We’ll do this in two parts to make it clear. First adjust the price index: 19 divided by 100 = 0.19. Then divide into

nominal GDP: $543.3 billion / 0.19 = $2,859.5 billion.

Step 3. Use the same formula to calculate the real GDP in 1965.

TABLE 6.6 Converting Nominal to Real GDP (Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis, www.bea.gov)

There are a couple things to notice here. Whenever you compute a real statistic, one year (or period) plays a

special role. It is called the base year (or base period). The base year is the year whose prices we use to compute

the real statistic. When we calculate real GDP, for example, we take the quantities of goods and services

produced in each year (for example, 1960 or 1973) and multiply them by their prices in the base year (in this

case, 2005), so we get a measure of GDP that uses prices that do not change from year to year. That is why real

GDP is labeled “Constant Dollars” or, in this example, “2005 Dollars,” which means that real GDP is constructed

152 6 • The Macroeconomic Perspective

using prices that existed in 2005. While the example here uses 2005 as the base year, more generally, you can

use any year as the base year. The formula is:

Rearranging the formula and using the data from 2005:

Comparing real GDP and nominal GDP for 2005, you see they are the same. This is no accident. It is because we

have chosen 2005 as the “base year” in this example. Since the price index in the base year always has a value of

100 (by definition), nominal and real GDP are always the same in the base year.

Look at the data for 2010.

Use this data to make another observation: As long as inflation is positive, meaning prices increase on average

from year to year, real GDP should be less than nominal GDP in any year after the base year. The reason for this

should be clear: The value of nominal GDP is “inflated” by inflation. Similarly, as long as inflation is positive, real

GDP should be greater than nominal GDP in any year before the base year.

Figure 6.9 shows the U.S. nominal and real GDP since 1960. Because 2005 is the base year, the nominal and

real values are exactly the same in that year. However, over time, the rise in nominal GDP looks much larger

than the rise in real GDP (that is, the nominal GDP line rises more steeply than the real GDP line), because the

presence of inflation, especially in the 1970s exaggerates the rise in nominal GDP.

FIGURE 6.9 U.S. Nominal and Real GDP, 1960–2020 The red line measures U.S. GDP in nominal dollars. The black

line measures U.S. GDP in real dollars, where all dollar values are converted to 2012 dollars. Since we express real

GDP in 2012 dollars, the two lines cross in 2012. However, real GDP will appear higher than nominal GDP in the

years before 2012, because dollars were worth less in 2012 than in previous years. Conversely, real GDP will appear

Access for free at openstax.org

6.3 • Tracking Real GDP over Time 153

lower in the years after 2012, because dollars were worth more in 2012 than in later years.

Let’s return to the question that we posed originally: How much did GDP increase in real terms? What was the

real GDP growth rate from 1960 to 2012? To find the real growth rate, we apply the formula for percentage

change:

In other words, the U.S. economy has increased real production of goods and services by nearly a factor of five

since 1960. Of course, that understates the material improvement since it fails to capture improvements in the

quality of products and the invention of new products.

There is a quicker way to answer this question approximately, using another math trick. Because:

Therefore, real GDP growth rate (% change in quantity) equals the growth rate in nominal GDP (% change in

value) minus the inflation rate (% change in price).

Note that using this equation provides an approximation for small changes in the levels. For more accurate

measures, one should use the first formula.

6.3 Tracking Real GDP over Time

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain recessions, depressions, peaks, and troughs

• Evaluate the importance of tracking real GDP over time

When news reports indicate that “the economy grew 1.2% in the first quarter,” the reports are referring to the

percentage change in real GDP. By convention, governments report GDP growth at an annualized rate:

Whatever the calculated growth in real GDP was for the quarter, we multiply it by four when it is reported as if

the economy were growing at that rate for a full year.

FIGURE 6.10 U.S. GDP, 1930–2020 Real GDP in the United States in 2020 (in 2012 dollars) was about $18.4

trillion. After adjusting to remove the effects of inflation, this represents a roughly 20-fold increase in the economy’s

production of goods and services since 1930. (Source: bea.gov)

154 6 • The Macroeconomic Perspective

Figure 6.10 shows the pattern of U.S. real GDP since 1930. Short term declines have regularly interrupted the

generally upward long-term path of GDP. We call a significant decline in real GDP a recession. We call an

especially lengthy and deep recession a depression. The severe drop in GDP that occurred during the 1930s

Great Depression is clearly visible in the figure, as is the 2008–2009 Great Recession and the recession

induced by COVID-19 in 2020.

Real GDP is important because it is highly correlated with other measures of economic activity, like

employment and unemployment. When real GDP rises, so does employment.

The most significant human problem associated with recessions (and their larger, uglier cousins, depressions)

is that a slowdown in production means that firms need to lay off or fire some of their workers. Losing a job

imposes painful financial and personal costs on workers, and often on their extended families as well. In

addition, even those who keep their jobs are likely to find that wage raises are scanty at best—or their

employers may ask them to take pay cuts.

Table 6.7 lists the pattern of recessions and expansions in the U.S. economy since 1900. We call the highest

point of the economy, before the recession begins, the peak. Conversely, the lowest point of a recession, before

a recovery begins, is the trough. Thus, a recession lasts from peak to trough, and an economic upswing runs

from trough to peak. We call the economy's movement from peak to trough and trough to peak the business

cycle. It is intriguing to notice that the three longest trough-to-peak expansions of the twentieth century have

happened since 1960. The most recent recession was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It started in

February 2020 and ended formally in May 2020. This was the most severe recession since the 1930s Great

Depression, but also the shortest. The previous recession, called the Great Recession, was also very severe and

lasted about 18 months. The expansion starting in June 2009, the trough from the Great Recession, was the

longest on record—ending 128 months with the pandemic-induced recession.

6.4 Comparing GDP among Countries

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain how we can use GDP to compare the economic welfare of different nations

• Calculate the conversion of GDP to a common currency by using exchange rates

• Calculate GDP per capita using population data

It is common to use GDP as a measure of economic welfare or standard of living in a nation. When comparing

the GDP of different nations for this purpose, two issues immediately arise. First, we measure a country's GDP

in its own currency: the United States uses the U.S. dollar; Canada, the Canadian dollar; most countries of

Western Europe, the euro; Japan, the yen; Mexico, the peso; and so on. Thus, comparing GDP between two

countries requires converting to a common currency. A second issue is that countries have very different

numbers of people. For instance, the United States has a much larger economy than Mexico or Canada, but it

also has almost three times as many people as Mexico and nine times as many people as Canada. Thus, if we

are trying to compare standards of living across countries, we need to divide GDP by population.

Converting Currencies with Exchange Rates

To compare the GDP of countries with different currencies, it is necessary to convert to a “common

denominator” using an exchange rate, which is the value of one currency in terms of another currency. We

express exchange rates either as the units of country A’s currency that need to be traded for a single unit of

country B’s currency (for example, Japanese yen per British pound), or as the inverse (for example, British

pounds per Japanese yen). We can use two types of exchange rates for this purpose, market exchange rates

156 6 • The Macroeconomic Perspective

and purchasing power parity (PPP) equivalent exchange rates. Market exchange rates vary on a day-to-day

basis depending on supply and demand in foreign exchange markets. PPP-equivalent exchange rates provide a

longer run measure of the exchange rate. For this reason, economists typically use PPP-equivalent exchange

rates for GDP cross country comparisons. We will discuss exchange rates in more detail in Exchange Rates and

International Capital Flows. The following Work It Out feature explains how to convert GDP to a common

currency.

WORK IT OUT

Converting GDP to a Common Currency
Using the exchange rate to convert GDP from one currency to another is straightforward. Say that the task is to

compare Brazil’s GDP in 2020 of 7.4 trillion reals with the U.S. GDP of $20.9 trillion for the same year.

Step 1. Determine the exchange rate for the specified year. In 2020, the exchange rate was 2.362 reals = $1.

(These numbers are realistic, but rounded off to simplify the calculations.)

Step 2. Convert Brazil’s GDP into U.S. dollars:

Step 3. Compare this value to the GDP in the United States in the same year. The U.S. GDP was $20.9 trillion in

2020, which is almost seven times that of GDP in Brazil.

Step 4. View Table 6.8 which shows the size of and variety of GDPs of different countries in 2020, all expressed in

U.S. dollars. We calculate each using the process that we explained above.

GDP Per Capita

The U.S. economy has the largest GDP in the world, by a considerable amount. The United States is also a

populous country; in fact, it is the third largest country by population in the world, although well behind China

and India. Is the U.S. economy larger than other countries just because the United States has more people than

most other countries, or because the U.S. economy is actually larger on a per-person basis? We can answer this

question by calculating a country’s GDP per capita; that is, the GDP divided by the population.

The second column of Table 6.9 lists the GDP of the same selection of countries that appeared in the previous

Tracking Real GDP over Time and Table 6.8, showing their GDP as converted into U.S. dollars (which is the

same as the last column of the previous table). The third column gives the population for each country. The

fourth column lists the GDP per capita. We obtain GDP per capita in two steps: First, by multiplying column two

(GDP, in billions of dollars) by 1000 so it has the same units as column three (Population, in millions). Then

divide the result (GDP in millions of dollars) by column three (Population, in millions).

Notice that the rankings by GDP in billions of U.S. dollars, and by GDP per capita, are different than the ranking

of GDP by each country’s currency. Measured by its own currency, the rupee, India has a somewhat larger GDP

than Germany. On a per capita basis in U.S. dollars, Germany has more than 9 times India’s per capita GDP on

PPP terms.

CLEAR IT UP

Is China going to surpass the United States in terms of standard of living?
China has the largest GDP in PPP terms: $24 trillion compared to the United States’ $21 trillion. But China has a
much larger population so that in per capita terms, its GDP is less than one fourth that of the United States ($17,000

compared to $63,000). The Chinese people are still quite poor relative to the United States and other developed

countries. One caveat: For reasons we will discuss shortly, GDP per capita can give us only a rough idea of the

differences in living standards across countries.

The world’s high-income nations—including the United States, Canada, the Western European countries, and

Japan—typically have GDP per capita in the range of $20,000 to $50,000. Middle-income countries, which

include much of Latin America, Eastern Europe, and some countries in East Asia, have GDP per capita in the

range of $6,000 to $12,000. The world's low-income countries, many of them located in Africa and Asia, often

have GDP per capita of less than $2,000 per year.

6.5 How Well GDP Measures the Well-Being of Society

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Discuss how productivity influences the standard of living

• Explain the limitations of GDP as a measure of the standard of living

• Analyze the relationship between GDP data and fluctuations in the standard of living

The level of GDP per capita clearly captures some of what we mean by the phrase “standard of living.” Most of

the migration in the world, for example, involves people who are moving from countries with relatively low

GDP per capita to countries with relatively high GDP per capita.

“Standard of living” is a broader term than GDP. While GDP focuses on production that is bought and sold in

markets, standard of living includes all elements that affect people’s well-being, whether they are bought and

sold in the market or not. To illuminate the difference between GDP and standard of living, it is useful to spell

out some things that GDP does not cover that are clearly relevant to standard of living.

Limitations of GDP as a Measure of the Standard of Living

GDP measures economic activity, not all activity. As a result, economists like Kate Raworth see it as a

somewhat outdated and limited indication of well-being and prosperity. While GDP measures output of work

done at home, as well as spending on travel, it doesn't capture unpaid work or leisure time. So, two countries

may have equal GDP, but one nation's workers may have an average workday of eight hours, while the other has

an average workday of twelve hours. In that case, is their equal GDP truly measuring the prosperity of those

6.5 • How Well GDP Measures the Well-Being of Society 159

nations? The GDP per capita of the U.S. economy is larger than the GDP per capita of Germany, as Table 6.9

showed, but does that prove that the standard of living in the United States is higher? Not necessarily, since it

is also true that the average U.S. worker works several hundred hours more per year more than the average

German worker. Calculating GDP does not account for the German worker’s extra vacation weeks.

While GDP includes what a country spends on environmental protection, healthcare, and education, it does

not include actual levels of environmental cleanliness, health, and learning. GDP includes the cost of buying

pollution-control equipment, but it does not address whether the air and water are actually cleaner or dirtier.

GDP includes spending on medical care, but does not address whether life expectancy or infant mortality have

risen or fallen. Similarly, it counts spending on education, but does not address directly how much of the

population can read, write, or do basic mathematics.

GDP includes production that is exchanged in the market, but it does not cover production that is not

exchanged in the market. For example, hiring someone to mow your lawn or clean your house is part of GDP,

but doing these tasks yourself is not part of GDP. One remarkable change in the U.S. economy in recent

decades is the growth in women’s participation in the labor force. As of 1970, only about 42% of women

participated in the paid labor force. By the second decade of the 2000s, nearly 60% of women participated in
the paid labor force according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As women are now in the labor force, many of
the services they used to produce in the non-market economy like food preparation and child care have shifted

to some extent into the market economy, which makes the GDP appear larger even if people actually are not

consuming more services. However, as Raworth points out and was explored in the chapter on the labor

market, even women who are fully employed expend significant effort (generally more than men) in raising

children and maintaining a home. Raworth advocates that economic measures include monetized and un-

monetized goods and services, so that the status and contributors to each economy are more accurate.

GDP has nothing to say about the level of inequality in society. GDP per capita is only an average. When GDP

per capita rises by 5%, it could mean that GDP for everyone in the society has risen by 5%, or that GDP of some

groups has risen by more while that of others has risen by less—or even declined. GDP also has nothing in

particular to say about the amount of variety available. If a family buys 100 loaves of bread in a year, GDP does

not care whether they are all white bread, or whether the family can choose from wheat, rye, pumpernickel,

and many others—it just looks at the total amount the family spends on bread.

Likewise, GDP has nothing much to say about what technology and products are available. The standard of

living in, for example, 1950 or 1900 was not affected only by how much money people had—it was also affected

by what they could buy. No matter how much money you had in 1950, you could not buy an iPhone or a

personal computer.

In certain cases, it is not clear that a rise in GDP is even a good thing. If a city is wrecked by a hurricane, and
then experiences a surge of rebuilding construction activity, it would be peculiar to claim that the hurricane

was therefore economically beneficial. If people are led by a rising fear of crime, to pay for installing bars and

burglar alarms on all their windows, it is hard to believe that this increase in GDP has made them better off.

Similarly, some people would argue that sales of certain goods, like pornography or extremely violent movies,

do not represent a gain to society’s standard of living.

Does a Rise in GDP Overstate or Understate the Rise in the Standard of Living?

The fact that GDP per capita does not fully capture the broader idea of standard of living has led to a concern

that the increases in GDP over time are illusory. It is theoretically possible that while GDP is rising, the

standard of living could be falling if human health, environmental cleanliness, and other factors that are not

included in GDP are worsening. Fortunately, this fear appears to be overstated.

In some ways, the rise in GDP understates the actual rise in the standard of living. For example, the typical

workweek for a U.S. worker has fallen over the last century from about 60 hours per week to less than 40 hours

per week. Life expectancy and health have risen dramatically, and so has the average level of education. Since

160 6 • The Macroeconomic Perspective

1970, the air and water in the United States have generally been getting cleaner. Companies have developed

new technologies for entertainment, travel, information, and health. A much wider variety of basic products

like food and clothing is available today than several decades ago. Because GDP does not capture leisure,

health, a cleaner environment, the possibilities that new technology creates, or an increase in variety, the

actual rise in the standard of living for Americans in recent decades has exceeded the rise in GDP.

On the other side, crime rates, traffic congestion levels, and income inequality are higher in the United States

now than they were in the 1960s. Moreover, a substantial number of services that women primarily provided in

the non-market economy are now part of the market economy that GDP counts. By ignoring these factors, GDP

would tend to overstate the true rise in the standard of living.

GDP is Rough, but Useful

A high level of GDP should not be the only goal of macroeconomic policy, or government policy more broadly.

Even though GDP does not measure the broader standard of living with any precision, it does measure

production well and it does indicate when a country is materially better or worse off in terms of jobs and

incomes. In most countries, a significantly higher GDP per capita occurs hand in hand with other

improvements in everyday life along many dimensions, like education, health, and environmental protection.

No single number can capture all the elements of a term as broad as “standard of living.” Nonetheless, GDP per

capita is a reasonable, rough-and-ready measure of the standard of living.

How is the Economy Doing? How Does One Tell?
To determine the state of the economy, one needs to examine economic indicators, such as GDP. To calculate GDP is

quite an undertaking. It is the broadest measure of a nation’s economic activity and we owe a debt to Simon

Kuznets, the creator of the measurement, for that.

The sheer size of the U.S. economy as measured by nominal GDP is huge—as of the third quarter of 2021, $23.2

trillion worth of goods and services were produced annually. During the COVID-19-induced recession, which lasted

just two months according to NBER and was concentrated across Quarters 1 and 2 of 2020, real GDP dropped

9%—much larger and quicker of a drop than during the previous economic downturn, the Great Recession
(2007–2009). The economy quickly bounced back, and as of Quarter 1 of 2021, real GDP had slightly surpassed the

level it was at prior to the start of the pandemic. These statistics show the severity of the pandemic-induced

recession, and while real GDP fully recovered, there are other ways in which the economy has not. While GDP and

GDP per capita give us a rough estimate of a nation's standard of living, there are many other ways to track the

health of the economy. This chapter is the building block for other chapters that explore more economic indicators

such as unemployment, inflation, or interest rates, and perhaps more importantly, will explain how they are related

and what causes them to rise or fall.

Key Concepts and Summary

6.1 Measuring the Size of the Economy: Gross Domestic Product

Economists generally express the size of a nation’s economy as its gross domestic product (GDP), which

measures the value of the output of all goods and services produced within the country in a year. Economists

measure GDP by taking the quantities of all goods and services produced, multiplying them by their prices,

and summing the total. Since GDP measures what is bought and sold in the economy, we can measure it either

by the sum of what is purchased in the economy or what is produced.

We can divide demand into consumption, investment, government, exports, and imports. We can divide what

is produced in the economy into durable goods, nondurable goods, services, structures, and inventories. To

avoid double counting, GDP counts only final output of goods and services, not the production of intermediate

goods or the value of labor in the chain of production.

162 6 • Self-Check Questions

6.2 Adjusting Nominal Values to Real Values

The nominal value of an economic statistic is the commonly announced value. The real value is the value after

adjusting for changes in inflation. To convert nominal economic data from several different years into real,

inflation-adjusted data, the starting point is to choose a base year arbitrarily and then use a price index to

convert the measurements so that economists measure them in the money prevailing in the base year.

6.3 Tracking Real GDP over Time

Over the long term, U.S. real GDP have increased dramatically. At the same time, GDP has not increased the

same amount each year. The speeding up and slowing down of GDP growth represents the business cycle.

When GDP declines significantly, a recession occurs. A longer and deeper decline is a depression. Recessions

begin at the business cycle's peak and end at the trough.

6.4 Comparing GDP among Countries

Since we measure GDP in a country’s currency, in order to compare different countries’ GDPs, we need to

convert them to a common currency. One way to do that is with the exchange rate, which is the price of one

country’s currency in terms of another. Once we express GDPs in a common currency, we can compare each

country’s GDP per capita by dividing GDP by population. Countries with large populations often have large

GDPs, but GDP alone can be a misleading indicator of a nation's wealth. A better measure is GDP per capita.

6.5 How Well GDP Measures the Well-Being of Society

GDP is an indicator of a society’s standard of living, but it is only a rough indicator. GDP does not directly take

account of leisure, environmental quality, levels of health and education, activities conducted outside the

market, changes in inequality of income, increases in variety, increases in technology, or the (positive or

negative) value that society may place on certain types of output.

20. U.S. macroeconomic data are among the best in the world. Given what you learned in the Clear It Up "How

do statisticians measure GDP?", does this surprise you, or does this simply reflect the complexity of a
modern economy?

21. What does GDP not tell us about the economy?

22. Should people typically pay more attention to their real income or their nominal income? If you choose

the latter, why would that make sense in today’s world? Would your answer be the same for the 1970s?

23. Why do you suppose that U.S. GDP is so much higher today than 50 or 100 years ago?

24. Why do you think that GDP does not grow at a steady rate, but rather speeds up and slows down?

25. Cross country comparisons of GDP per capita typically use purchasing power parity equivalent exchange

rates, which are a measure of the long run equilibrium value of an exchange rate. In fact, we used PPP

equivalent exchange rates in this module. Why could using market exchange rates, which sometimes

change dramatically in a short period of time, be misleading?

Introduction to Economic Growth

BRING IT HOME

Calories and Economic Growth
On average, humans need about 2,500 calories a day to survive, depending on height, weight, and gender. The

economist Brad DeLong estimates that the average worker in the early 1600s earned wages that could afford him

2,500 food calories. This worker lived in Western Europe. Two hundred years later, that same worker could afford

3,000 food calories. However, between 1800 and 1875, just a time span of just 75 years, economic growth was so

rapid that western European workers could purchase 5,000 food calories a day. By 2012, a low skilled worker in an

affluent Western European/North American country could afford to purchase 2.4 million food calories per day.

What caused such a rapid rise in living standards between 1800 and 1875 and thereafter? Why is it that many

countries, especially those in Western Europe, North America, and parts of East Asia, can feed their populations

more than adequately, while others cannot? We will look at these and other questions as we examine long-run

economic growth.

166 7 • Economic Growth

Every country worries about economic growth. In the United States and other high-income countries, the

question is whether economic growth continues to provide the same remarkable gains in our standard of living

as it did during the twentieth century. Meanwhile, can middle-income countries like Brazil, Egypt, or Poland

catch up to the higher-income countries, or must they remain in the second tier of per capita income? Of the

world’s population of roughly 7.5 billion people, about 1.1 billion are scraping by on incomes that average less

than $2 per day, not that different from the standard of living 2,000 years ago. Can the world’s poor be lifted

from their fearful poverty? As the 1995 Nobel laureate in economics, Robert E. Lucas Jr., once noted: “The

consequences for human welfare involved in questions like these are simply staggering: Once one starts to

think about them, it is hard to think about anything else.”

Dramatic improvements in a nation’s standard of living are possible. After the Korean War in the late 1950s,

the Republic of Korea, often called South Korea, was one of the poorest economies in the world. Most South

Koreans worked in peasant agriculture. According to the British economist Angus Maddison, who devoted life’s

work to measuring GDP and population in the world economy, GDP per capita in 1990 international dollars

was $854 per year. From the 1960s to the early twenty-first century, a time period well within the lifetime and

memory of many adults, the South Korean economy grew rapidly. Over these four decades, GDP per capita

increased by more than 6% per year. According to the World Bank, GDP for South Korea now exceeds $30,000

in nominal terms, placing it firmly among high-income countries like Italy, New Zealand, and Israel. Measured

by total GDP in 2015, South Korea is the eleventh-largest economy in the world. For a nation of 50 million

people, this transformation is extraordinary.

South Korea is a standout example, but it is not the only case of rapid and sustained economic growth. Other

East Asian nations, like Thailand and Indonesia, have seen very rapid growth as well. China has grown

enormously since it enacted market-oriented economic reforms around 1980. GDP per capita in high-income

economies like the United States also has grown dramatically albeit over a longer time frame. Since the Civil

War, the U.S. economy has transformed from a primarily rural and agricultural economy to an economy based

on services, manufacturing, and technology.

7.1 The Relatively Recent Arrival of Economic Growth

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain the conditions that have allowed for modern economic growth in the last two centuries

• Analyze the influence of public policies on an economy's long-run economic growth

Let’s begin with a brief overview of spectacular economic growth patterns around the world in the last two

centuries. We commonly refer to this as the period of modern economic growth. (Later in the chapter we will

discuss lower economic growth rates and some key ingredients for economic progress.) Rapid and sustained
economic growth is a relatively recent experience for the human race. Before the last two centuries, although

rulers, nobles, and conquerors could afford some extravagances and although economies rose above the

subsistence level, the average person’s standard of living had not changed much for centuries.

Progressive, powerful economic and institutional changes started to have a significant effect in the late

eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. According to the Dutch economic historian Jan Luiten van Zanden,

slavery-based societies, favorable demographics, global trading routes, and standardized trading institutions

that spread with different empires set the stage for the Industrial Revolution to succeed. The Industrial

Revolution refers to the widespread use of power-driven machinery and the economic and social changes that

resulted in the first half of the 1800s. Ingenious machines—the steam engine, the power loom, and the steam

locomotive—performed tasks that otherwise would have taken vast numbers of workers to do. The Industrial

Revolution began in Great Britain, and soon spread to the United States, Germany, and other countries.

The jobs for ordinary people working with these machines were often dirty and dangerous by modern

standards, but the alternative jobs of that time in peasant agriculture and small-village industry were often

7.1 • The Relatively Recent Arrival of Economic Growth 167

dirty and dangerous, too. The new jobs of the Industrial Revolution typically offered higher pay and a chance

for social mobility. A self-reinforcing cycle began: New inventions and investments generated profits, the

profits provided funds for more new investment and inventions, and the investments and inventions provided

opportunities for further profits. Slowly, a group of national economies in Europe and North America emerged

from centuries of sluggishness into a period of rapid modern growth. During the last two centuries, the average

GDP growth rate per capita in the leading industrialized countries has been about 2% per year. What were

times like before then? Read the following Clear It Up feature for the answer.

CLEAR IT UP

What were economic conditions like before 1870?
Angus Maddison, a quantitative economic historian, led the most systematic inquiry into national incomes before

1870. Economists recently have refined and used his methods to compile GDP per capita estimates from year 1 C.E.

to 1348. Table 7.1 is an important counterpoint to most of the narrative in this chapter. It shows that nations can

decline as well as rise. A wide array of forces, such as epidemics, natural and weather-related disasters, the inability

to govern large empires, and the remarkably slow pace of technological and institutional progress explain declines in
income. Institutions are the traditions and laws by which people in a community agree to behave and govern
themselves. Such institutions include marriage, religion, education, and laws of governance. Institutional progress is

the development and codification of these institutions to reinforce social order, and thus, economic growth.

One example of such an institution is the Magna Carta (Great Charter), which the English nobles forced King John to

sign in 1215. The Magna Carta codified the principles of due process, whereby a free man could not be penalized

unless his peers had made a lawful judgment against him. The United States in its own constitution later adopted

this concept. This social order may have contributed to England’s GDP per capita in 1348, which was second to that

of northern Italy.

In studying economic growth, a country’s institutional framework plays a critical role. Table 7.1 also shows relative

global equality for almost 1,300 years. After this, we begin to see significant divergence in income (not in the table).

Growth Before 1820.” 2013)

Another fascinating and underreported fact is the high levels of income, compared to others at that time, attained by

the Islamic Empire Abbasid Caliphate—which was founded in present-day Iraq in 730 C.E. At its height, the empire

spanned large regions of the Middle East, North Africa, and Spain until its gradual decline over 200 years.

168 7 • Economic Growth

The Industrial Revolution led to increasing inequality among nations. Some economies took off, whereas

others, like many of those in Africa or Asia, remained close to a subsistence standard of living. General

calculations show that the 17 countries of the world with the most-developed economies had, on average, 2.4

times the GDP per capita of the world’s poorest economies in 1870. By 1960, the most developed economies

had 4.2 times the GDP per capita of the poorest economies.

However, by the middle of the twentieth century, some countries had shown that catching up was possible.

Japan’s economic growth took off in the 1960s and 1970s, with a growth rate of real GDP per capita averaging

11% per year during those decades. Certain countries in Latin America experienced a boom in economic

growth in the 1960s as well. In Brazil, for example, GDP per capita expanded by an average annual rate of

11.1% from 1968 to 1973. In the 1970s, some East Asian economies, including South Korea, Thailand, and

Taiwan, saw rapid growth. In these countries, growth rates of 11% to 12% per year in GDP per capita were not

uncommon. More recently, China, with its population of nearly 1.4 billion people, grew at a per capita rate 9%

per year from 1984 into the 2000s and still average high rates of growth (more than 5% today). India, with a

population of 1.4 billion, has shown promising signs of economic growth, with growth in GDP per capita of

about 4% per year during the 1990s and climbing toward 7% to 8% per year in the 2000s and 2010s.

These waves of catch-up economic growth have not reached all shores. In certain African countries like Niger,

Tanzania, and Sudan, for example, GDP per capita at the start of the 2000s was still less than $300, not much

higher than it was in the nineteenth century and for centuries before that. In the context of the overall situation

of low-income people around the world, the good economic news from China (population: 1.4 billion) and India

(population: 1.3 billion) is, nonetheless, astounding and heartening.

Economic growth in the last two centuries has made a striking change in the human condition. Richard

Easterlin, an economist at the University of Southern California, wrote in 2000:

By many measures, a revolution in the human condition is sweeping the world. Most people today are

better fed, clothed, and housed than their predecessors two centuries ago. They are healthier, live

longer, and are better educated. Women’s lives are less centered on reproduction and political

democracy has gained a foothold. Although Western Europe and its offshoots have been the leaders of

this advance, most of the less developed nations have joined in during the 20th century, with the

newly emerging nations of sub-Saharan Africa the latest to participate. Although the picture is not one

of universal progress, it is the greatest advance in the human condition of the world’s population ever

achieved in such a brief span of time.

Rule of Law and Economic Growth

Economic growth depends on many factors. Key among those factors is adherence to the rule of law and

protection of property rights and contractual rights by a country’s government so that markets can work

effectively and efficiently. Laws must be clear, public, fair, enforced, and equally applicable to all members of

society. Property rights, as you might recall from Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities

(http://openstax.org/books/principles-economics-3e/pages/12-introduction-to-environmental-protection-

and-negative-externalities) are the rights of individuals and firms to own property and use it as they see fit. If

you have $100, you have the right to use that money, whether you spend it, lend it, or keep it in a jar. It is your

property. The definition of property includes physical property as well as the right to your training and

experience, especially since your training is what determines your livelihood. Using this property includes the

right to enter into contracts with other parties with your property. Individuals or firms must own the property

to enter into a contract.

Access for free at openstax.org

7.2 • Labor Productivity and Economic Growth 169

Contractual rights, then, are based on property rights and they allow individuals to enter into agreements with

others regarding the use of their property providing recourse through the legal system in the event of

noncompliance. One example is the employment agreement: a skilled surgeon operates on an ill person and

expects payment. Failure to pay would constitute property theft by the patient. The theft is property the

services that the surgeon provided. In a society with strong property rights and contractual rights, the terms of

the patient–surgeon contract will be fulfilled, because the surgeon would have recourse through the court

system to extract payment from that individual. Without a legal system that enforces contracts, people would

not be likely to enter into contracts for current or future services because of the risk of non-payment. This

would make it difficult to transact business and would slow economic growth.

The World Bank considers a country’s legal system effective if it upholds property rights and contractual

rights. The World Bank has developed a ranking system for countries’ legal systems based on effective

protection of property rights and rule-based governance using a scale from 1 to 6, with 1 being the lowest and

6 the highest rating. In 2020, the world average ranking was 2.9. The three countries with the lowest ranking of

1.0 were Somalia and Eritrea, with South Sudan at 1.5. Their GDP per capita was $875, $1,625, and $1,234.70

respectively. The World Bank also cites Afghanistan (GDP per capita $2,087.60) as having a low standard of

living, weak government structure, and lack of adherence to the rule of law, which has stymied its economic

growth. The landlocked Central African Republic (GDP per capita $979.60) has poor economic resources as

well as political instability and is a source of children used in human trafficking. Zimbabwe (GDP per capita

$2,895.40) has had declining and often negative growth for much of the period since 1998. Land redistribution

and price controls have disrupted the economy, and corruption and violence have dominated the political

process. Although global economic growth has increased, those countries lacking a clear system of property

rights and an independent court system free from corruption have lagged far behind.

7.2 Labor Productivity and Economic Growth

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•

Identify the role of labor productivity in promoting economic growth

• Analyze the sources of economic growth using the aggregate production function

• Measure an economy’s rate of productivity growth

• Evaluate the power of sustained growth

Sustained long-term economic growth comes from increases in worker productivity, which essentially means

how well we do things. In other words, how efficient is your nation with its time and workers? Labor

productivity is the value that each employed person creates per unit of their input. The easiest way to

comprehend labor productivity is to imagine a Canadian worker who can make 10 loaves of bread in an hour

versus a U.S. worker who in the same hour can make only two loaves of bread. In this fictional example, the

Canadians are more productive. More productivity essentially means you can do more in the same amount of

time. This in turn frees up resources for workers to use elsewhere.

What determines how productive workers are? The answer is pretty intuitive. The first determinant of labor

productivity is human capital. Human capital is the accumulated knowledge (from education and experience),

skills, and expertise that the average worker in an economy possesses. Typically the higher the average level of

education in an economy, the higher the accumulated human capital and the higher the labor productivity.

The second factor that determines labor productivity is technological change. Technological change is a

combination of invention—advances in knowledge—and innovation, which is putting those advances to use in

a new product or service. For example, the transistor was invented in 1947. It allowed us to miniaturize the

footprint of electronic devices and use less power than the tube technology that came before it. Innovations

since then have produced smaller and better transistors that are ubiquitous in products as varied as smart-

phones, computers, and escalators. Developing the transistor has allowed workers to be anywhere with smaller

devices. People can use these devices to communicate with other workers, measure product quality or do any

170 7 • Economic Growth

other task in less time, improving worker productivity.

The third factor that determines labor productivity is economies of scale. Recall that economies of scale are the

cost advantages that industries obtain due to size. (Read more about economies of scale in Production, Cost

and Industry Structure (http://openstax.org/books/principles-economics-3e/pages/7-introduction-to-

production-costs-and-industry-structure).) Consider again the case of the fictional Canadian worker who could

produce 10 loaves of bread in an hour. If this difference in productivity was due only to economies of scale, it

could be that the Canadian worker had access to a large industrial-size oven while the U.S. worker was using a

standard residential size oven.

Now that we have explored the determinants of worker productivity, let’s turn to how economists measure

economic growth and productivity.

Sources of Economic Growth: The Aggregate Production Function

To analyze the sources of economic growth, it is useful to think about a production function, which is the

technical relationship by which economic inputs like labor, machinery, and raw materials are turned into

outputs like goods and services that consumers use. A microeconomic production function describes a firm's

or perhaps an industry's inputs and outputs. In macroeconomics, we call the connection from inputs to
outputs for the entire economy an aggregate production function.

Components of the Aggregate Production Function

Economists construct different production functions depending on the focus of their studies. Figure 7.2

presents two examples of aggregate production functions. In the first production function in Figure 7.2 (a), the

output is GDP. The inputs in this example are workforce, human capital, physical capital, and technology. We

discuss these inputs further in the module, Components of Economic Growth.

Access for free at openstax.org

7.2 • Labor Productivity and Economic Growth 171

FIGURE 7.2 Aggregate Production Functions An aggregate production function shows what goes into producing the

output for an overall economy. (a) This aggregate production function has GDP as its output. (b) This aggregate

production function has GDP per capita as its output. Because we calculate it on a per-person basis, we already

figure the labor input into the other factors and we do not need to list it separately.

Measuring Productivity

An economy’s rate of productivity growth is closely linked to the growth rate of its GDP per capita, although the

two are not identical. For example, if the percentage of the population who holds jobs in an economy increases,

GDP per capita will increase but the productivity of individual workers may not be affected. Over the long term,
the only way that GDP per capita can grow continually is if the productivity of the average worker rises or if

there are complementary increases in capital.

A common measure of U.S. productivity per worker is dollar value per hour the worker contributes to the

employer’s output. This measure excludes government workers, because their output is not sold in the market

and so their productivity is hard to measure. It also excludes farming, which accounts for only a relatively

small share of the U.S. economy. Figure 7.3 shows an index of output per hour, with 2012 as the base year

(when the index equals 100). The index equaled 110.5 in 2020. In 1977, the index equaled about 50, which

shows that workers have more than doubled their productivity since then.

172 7 • Economic Growth

FIGURE 7.3 Output per Hour Worked in the U.S. Economy, 1947–2020 Output per hour worked is a measure of

worker productivity. In the U.S. economy, worker productivity rose more quickly in the 1960s and the mid-1990s

compared with the 1970s and 1980s. However, these growth-rate differences are only a few percentage points per

year. Look carefully to see them in the changing slope of the line. The average U.S. worker produced over twice as

much per hour in 2020 than they did in the 1970s. (Source: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.)

A graph has an X-axis with years progressing from 1955 to 2020 and a Y axis labeled Percent Change at Annual

Rate. The graphed data moves up and down across a zero line indicating change year over year. In 1970, 1974,

1981, 1983, 2008, and 2020, the rate was quite low, as the U.S. was undergoing recessions.

According to the Department of Labor, U.S. productivity growth was fairly strong in the 1950s but then

declined in the 1970s and 1980s before rising again in the second half of the 1990s and the first half of the

2000s. In fact, the rate of productivity measured by the change in output per hour worked averaged 2.8% per

year from 1947 to 1973; dropped to 1.2% per year from 1973 to 1979; increased to 1.5% per year from 1979 to

1990; increased again to 2.2% from 1990 to 2000; increased even more to 2.7% from 2000 to 2007; and then

decreased to 1.4% from 2007 to 2020 Figure 7.4 shows average annual rates of productivity growth averaged
over time since 1947.

7.2 • Labor Productivity and Economic Growth 173

FIGURE 7.4 Productivity Growth Since 1947 U.S. growth in worker productivity was very high between 1947 and

1973. It then declined to lower levels in the later 1970s and the 1980s. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw

productivity rebound, but then productivity sagged a bit between 2001 and 2020. Some think the productivity

rebound of the late 1990s and early 2000s marks the start of a “new economy” built on higher productivity growth,

but we cannot determine this until more time has passed. (Source: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor

Statistics.)

The “New Economy” Controversy

In recent years a controversy has been brewing among economists about the resurgence of U.S. productivity in

the second half of the 1990s. One school of thought argues that the United States had developed a “new

economy” based on the extraordinary advances in communications and information technology of the 1990s.

The most optimistic proponents argue that it would generate higher average productivity growth for decades to

come. The pessimists, alternatively, argue that even five or ten years of stronger productivity growth does not

prove that higher productivity will last for the long term. It is hard to infer anything about long-term

productivity trends during the later part of the 2000s, because the steep 2008-2009 recession, with its sharp

but not completely synchronized declines in output and employment, complicates any interpretation. While

productivity growth was high in 2009 and 2010 (around 3%), it has slowed down over the last decade.

Productivity growth is also closely linked to the average level of wages. Over time, the amount that firms are

willing to pay workers will depend on the value of the output those workers produce. If a few employers tried to
pay their workers less than what those workers produced, then those workers would receive offers of higher

wages from other profit-seeking employers. If a few employers mistakenly paid their workers more than what

those workers produced, those employers would soon end up with losses. In the long run, productivity per

hour is the most important determinant of the average wage level in any economy. To learn how to compare

economies in this regard, follow the steps in the following Work It Out feature.

Comparing the Economies of Two Countries
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) tracks data on the annual growth rate of

real GDP per hour worked. You can find these data on the OECD data webpage “Growth in GDP per capita,

productivity and ULC” at this (http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=PDB_GR) website.

Step 1. Visit the OECD website given above and select two countries to compare.

174 7 • Economic Growth

Step 2. On the drop-down menu “Subject,” select “ GDP per capita, constant prices,” and under “Measure,”

select “Annual growth/change.” Then record the data for the countries you have chosen for the five most recent

years.

Step 3. Go back to the drop-down “Subject” menu and select “GDP per hour worked, constant prices,” and under

“Measure” again select “Annual growth/change.” Select data for the same years for which you selected GDP per

capita data.

Step 4. Compare real GDP growth for both countries. Table 7.2 provides an example of a comparison between

Australia and Belgium.

Step 5. For both measures, growth in Australia is greater than growth in Belgium for the first four years. In

addition, there are year-to-year fluctuations. Many factors can affect growth. For example, one factor that may

have contributed to Australia's stronger growth may be its larger inflows of immigrants, who generally contribute

to economic growth.

The Power of Sustained Economic Growth

Nothing is more important for people’s standard of living than sustained economic growth. Even small

changes in the rate of growth, when sustained and compounded over long periods of time, make an enormous

difference in the standard of living. Consider Table 7.3, in which the rows of the table show several different

rates of growth in GDP per capita and the columns show different periods of time. Assume for simplicity that

an economy starts with a GDP per capita of 100. The table then applies the following formula to calculate what

GDP will be at the given growth rate in the future:

For example, an economy that starts with a GDP of 100 and grows at 3% per year will reach a GDP of 209 after
25 years; that is, 100 (1.03)25 = 209.

The slowest rate of GDP per capita growth in the table, just 1% per year, is similar to what the United States

experienced during its weakest years of productivity growth. The second highest rate, 3% per year, is close to

what the U.S. economy experienced during the strong economy of the late 1990s and into the 2000s. Higher

rates of per capita growth, such as 5% or 8% per year, represent the experience of rapid growth in economies

like Japan, Korea, and China.

Table 7.3 shows that even a few percentage points of difference in economic growth rates will have a profound

effect if sustained and compounded over time. For example, an economy growing at a 1% annual rate over 50

years will see its GDP per capita rise by a total of 64%, from 100 to 164 in this example. However, a country

growing at a 5% annual rate will see (almost) the same amount of growth—from 100 to 163—over just 10 years.

Rapid rates of economic growth can bring profound transformation. (See the following Clear It Up feature on

the relationship between compound growth rates and compound interest rates.) If the rate of growth is 8%,

young adults starting at age 20 will see the average standard of living in their country more than double by the

time they reach age 30, and grow more than sixfold by the time they reach age 45.

CLEAR IT UP

How are compound growth rates and compound interest rates related?
The formula for GDP growth rates over different periods of time, as Figure 7.3 shows, is exactly the same as the

formula for how a given amount of financial savings grows at a certain interest rate over time, as presented in Choice

in a World of Scarcity. Both formulas have the same ingredients:

• an original starting amount, in one case GDP and in the other case an amount of financial saving;

• a percentage increase over time, in one case the GDP growth rate and in the other case an interest rate;

• and an amount of time over which this effect happens.

Recall that compound interest is interest that is earned on past interest. It causes the total amount of financial

savings to grow dramatically over time. Similarly, compound rates of economic growth, or the compound growth

rate, means that we multiply the rate of growth by a base that includes past GDP growth, with dramatic effects over

time.

For example, in 2020, the Central Intelligence Agency's World Fact Book reported that South Korea had a GDP of

$2.2 trillion. With a growth rate of 2.8% per year, South Korea's GDP will be $2.5 trillion in five years. If we apply the

growth rate to each year’s ending GDP for the next five years, we will calculate that at the end of year one, GDP is

$2.3 trillion. In year two, we start with the end-of-year one value of $1.72 and increase it by 2.8%. Year three starts

with the end-of-year two GDP, and we increase it by 2.8% and so on, as Table 7.4 depicts.

Another way to calculate the growth rate is to apply the following formula:

Where “future value” is the value of GDP five years hence, “present value” is the starting GDP amount of $1.67

trillion, “g” is the growth rate of 2.8%, and “n” is the number of periods for which we are calculating growth.

7.3 Components of Economic Growth

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Discuss the components of economic growth, including physical capital, human capital, and technology

• Explain capital deepening and its significance

• Analyze the methods employed in economic growth accounting studies

•

Identify factors that contribute to a healthy climate for economic growth

Over decades and generations, seemingly small differences of a few percentage points in the annual rate of

economic growth make an enormous difference in GDP per capita. In this module, we discuss some of the

components of economic growth, including physical capital, human capital, and technology.

The category of physical capital includes the plant and equipment that firms use as well as things like roads

(also called infrastructure). Again, greater physical capital implies more output. Physical capital can affect

productivity in two ways: (1) an increase in the quantityof physical capital (for example, more computers of

the same quality); and (2) an increase in the qualityof physical capital (same number of computers but the

computers are faster, and so on). Human capital refers to the skills and knowledge that make workers

productive. Human capital and physical capital accumulation are similar: In both cases, investment now pays

off in higher productivity in the future.

The category of technology is the “joker in the deck.” Earlier we described it as the combination of invention

and innovation. When most people think of new technology, the invention of new products like the laser, the

smartphone, or some new wonder drug come to mind. In food production, developing more drought-resistant

seeds is another example of technology. Technology, as economists use the term, however, includes still more.

It includes new ways of organizing work, like the invention of the assembly line, new methods for ensuring

better quality of output in factories, and innovative institutions that facilitate the process of converting inputs

into output. In short, technology comprises all the advances that make the existing machines and other inputs

produce more, and at higher quality, as well as altogether new products.

It may not make sense to compare the GDPs of China and say, Benin, simply because of the great difference in

population size. To understand economic growth, which is really concerned with the growth in living

standards of an average person, it is often useful to focus on GDP per capita. Using GDP per capita also makes

it easier to compare countries with smaller numbers of people, like Belgium, Uruguay, or Zimbabwe, with

countries that have larger populations, like the United States, the Russian Federation, or Nigeria.

To obtain a per capita production function, divide each input in Figure 7.2(a) by the population. This creates a

second aggregate production function where the output is GDP per capita (that is, GDP divided by population).

The inputs are the average level of human capital per person, the average level of physical capital per person,

and the level of technology per person—see Figure 7.2(b). The result of having population in the denominator

is mathematically appealing. Increases in population lower per capita income. However, increasing population

is important for the average person only if the rate of income growth exceeds population growth. A more

important reason for constructing a per capita production function is to understand the contribution of human

and physical capital.

Capital Deepening

When society increases the level of capital per person, we call the result capital deepening. The idea of capital

deepening can apply both to additional human capital per worker and to additional physical capital per

worker.

Recall that one way to measure human capital is to look at the average levels of education in an economy.

Figure 7.5 illustrates the human capital deepening for U.S. workers by showing that the proportion of the U.S.

population with a high school and a college degree is rising. As recently as 1970, for example, only about half of

U.S. adults had at least a high school diploma. By the start of the twenty-first century, more than 80% of adults

had graduated from high school. The idea of human capital deepening also applies to the years of experience

that workers have, but the average experience level of U.S. workers has not changed much in recent decades.

Thus, the key dimension for deepening human capital in the U.S. economy focuses more on additional

education and training than on a higher average level of work experience.

FIGURE 7.5 Human Capital Deepening in the U.S. Rising levels of education for persons 25 and older show the

deepening of human capital in the U.S. economy. Even today, under one-third of U.S. adults have completed a four-

year college degree. There is clearly room for additional deepening of human capital to occur. (Source: Penn World

Tables, 10.0 https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/?lang=en)

Figure 7.6 shows physical capital deepening in the U.S. economy. The average U.S. worker in the late 2000s was

working with physical capital worth almost three times as much as that of the average worker of the early

1950s.

178 7 • Economic Growth

FIGURE 7.6 Physical Capital per Worker in the United States The value of the physical capital, measured by plant

and equipment, used by the average worker in the U.S. economy has risen over the decades. The increase may have

leveled off a bit in the 1970s and 1980s, which were, not coincidentally, times of slower-than-usual growth in

worker productivity. We see a renewed increase in physical capital per worker in the late 1990s, followed by a

flattening in the early 2000s. (Source: Center for International Comparisons of Production, Income and Prices,

University of Pennsylvania)

Not only does the current U.S. economy have better-educated workers with more and improved physical

capital than it did several decades ago, but these workers have access to more advanced technologies. Growth

in technology is impossible to measure with a simple line on a graph, but evidence that we live in an age of

technological marvels is all around us—discoveries in genetics and in the structure of particles, the wireless

internet, and other inventions almost too numerous to count. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office typically

has issued more than 150,000 patents annually in recent years.

This recipe for economic growth—investing in labor productivity, with investments in human capital and

technology, as well as increasing physical capital—also applies to other economies. South Korea, for example,

already achieved universal enrollment in primary school (the equivalent of kindergarten through sixth grade

in the United States) by 1965, when Korea’s GDP per capita was still near its rock bottom low. By the late 1980s,

Korea had achieved almost universal secondary school education (the equivalent of a high school education in

the United States). With regard to physical capital, Korea’s rates of investment had been about 15% of GDP at

the start of the 1960s, but doubled to 30–35% of GDP by the late 1960s and early 1970s. With regard to

technology, South Korean students went to universities and colleges around the world to obtain scientific and

technical training, and South Korean firms reached out to study and form partnerships with firms that could

offer them technological insights. These factors combined to foster South Korea’s high rate of economic

growth.

Growth Accounting Studies

Since the late 1950s, economists have conducted growth accounting studies to determine the extent to which

physical and human capital deepening and technology have contributed to growth. The usual approach uses

an aggregate production function to estimate how much of per capita economic growth can be attributed to

Access for free at openstax.org

7.3 • Components of Economic Growth 179

growth in physical capital and human capital. We can measure these two inputs at least roughly. The part of

growth that is unexplained by measured inputs, called the residual, is then attributed to growth in technology.

The exact numerical estimates differ from study to study and from country to country, depending on how

researchers measured these three main factors and over what time horizons. For studies of the U.S. economy,

three lessons commonly emerge from growth accounting studies.

First, technology is typically the most important contributor to U.S. economic growth. Growth in human capital

and physical capital often explains only half or less than half of the economic growth that occurs. New ways of

doing things are tremendously important.

Second, while investment in physical capital is essential to growth in labor productivity and GDP per capita,

building human capital is at least as important. Economic growth is not just a matter of more machines and

buildings. One vivid example of the power of human capital and technological knowledge occurred in Europe

in the years after World War II (1939–1945). During the war, a large share of Europe’s physical capital, such as

factories, roads, and vehicles, was destroyed. Europe also lost an overwhelming amount of human capital in

the form of millions of men, women, and children who died during the war. However, the powerful

combination of skilled workers and technological knowledge, working within a market-oriented economic
framework, rebuilt Europe’s productive capacity to an even higher level within less than two decades.

A third lesson is that these three factors of human capital, physical capital, and technology work together.

Workers with a higher level of education and skills are often better at coming up with new technological

innovations. These technological innovations are often ideas that cannot increase production until they

become a part of new investment in physical capital. New machines that embody technological innovations

often require additional training, which builds worker skills further. If the recipe for economic growth is to

succeed, an economy needs all the ingredients of the aggregate production function. See the following Clear It

Up feature for an example of how human capital, physical capital, and technology can combine to significantly

impact lives.

How do girls’ education and economic growth relate in low-income countries?
In the early 2000s, according to the World Bank, about 110 million children between the ages of 6 and 11 were not

in school—and about two-thirds of them were girls. In Afghanistan, for example, the literacy rate for those aged

15-24 for the period 2005-2014 was 62% for males and only 32% for females. In Benin, in West Africa, it was 55%

for males and 31% for females. In Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, it was 76% for males and 58 percent for

females.

Whenever any child does not receive a basic education, it is both a human and an economic loss. In low-income

countries, wages typically increase by an average of 10 to 20% with each additional year of education. There is,

however, some intriguing evidence that helping girls in low-income countries to close the education gap with boys

may be especially important, because of the social role that many of the girls will play as mothers and homemakers.

Girls in low-income countries who receive more education tend to grow up to have fewer, healthier, better-educated

children. Their children are more likely to be better nourished and to receive basic health care like immunizations.

Economic research on women in low-income economies backs up these findings. When 20 women obtain one

additional year of schooling, as a group they will, on average, have one less child. When 1,000 women obtain one

additional year of schooling, on average one to two fewer women from that group will die in childbirth. When a

woman stays in school an additional year, that factor alone means that, on average, each of her children will spend

an additional half-year in school. Education for girls is a good investment because it is an investment in economic

growth with benefits beyond the current generation.

180 7 • Economic Growth

A Healthy Climate for Economic Growth

While physical and human capital deepening and better technology are important, equally important to a

nation’s well-being is the climate or system within which these inputs are cultivated. Both the type of market

economy and a legal system that governs and sustains property rights and contractual rights are important

contributors to a healthy economic climate.

A healthy economic climate usually involves some sort of market orientation at the microeconomic, individual,

or firm decision-making level. Markets that allow personal and business rewards and incentives for increasing

human and physical capital encourage overall macroeconomic growth. For example, when workers participate

in a competitive and well-functioning labor market, they have an incentive to acquire additional human

capital, because additional education and skills will pay off in higher wages. Firms have an incentive to invest

in physical capital and in training workers, because they expect to earn higher profits for their shareholders.

Both individuals and firms look for new technologies, because even small inventions can make work easier or

lead to product improvement. Collectively, such individual and business decisions made within a market

structure add up to macroeconomic growth. Much of the rapid growth since the late nineteenth century has

come from harnessing the power of competitive markets to allocate resources. This market orientation
typically reaches beyond national borders and includes openness to international trade.

A general orientation toward markets does not rule out important roles for government. There are times when

markets fail to allocate capital or technology in a manner that provides the greatest benefit for society as a

whole. The government's role is to correct these failures. In addition, government can guide or influence

markets toward certain outcomes. The following examples highlight some important areas that governments

around the world have chosen to invest in to facilitate capital deepening and technology:

• Education. The Danish government requires all children under 16 to attend school. They can choose to

attend a public school (Folkeskole) or a private school. Students do not pay tuition to attend Folkeskole.

Thirteen percent of primary/secondary (elementary/high) school is private, and the government supplies

vouchers to citizens who choose private school.

• Savings and Investment. In the United States, as in other countries, the government taxes gains from

private investment. Low capital gains taxes encourage investment and so also economic growth.

•

Infrastructure. The Japanese government in the mid-1990s undertook significant infrastructure projects

to improve roads and public works. This in turn increased the stock of physical capital and ultimately

economic growth.

• Special Economic Zones. The island of Mauritius is one of the few African nations to encourage

international trade in government-supported special economic zones (SEZ). These are areas of the

country, usually with access to a port where, among other benefits, the government does not tax trade. As a

result of its SEZ, Mauritius has enjoyed above-average economic growth since the 1980s. Free trade does

not have to occur in an SEZ however. Governments can encourage international trade across the board, or

surrender to protectionism.

• Scientific Research. The European Union has strong programs to invest in scientific research. The

researchers Abraham García and Pierre Mohnen demonstrate that firms which received support from the

Austrian government actually increased their research intensity and had more sales. Governments can

support scientific research and technical training that helps to create and spread new technologies.

Governments can also provide a legal environment that protects the ability of inventors to profit from their

inventions.

There are many more ways in which the government can play an active role in promoting economic growth.

We explore them in other chapters and in particular in Macroeconomic Policy Around the World. A healthy

climate for growth in GDP per capita and labor productivity includes human capital deepening, physical

capital deepening, and technological gains, operating in a market-oriented economy with supportive

government policies.

7.4 Economic Convergence

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain economic convergence

• Analyze various arguments for and against economic convergence

• Evaluate the speed of economic convergence between high-income countries and the rest of the world

Some low-income and middle-income economies around the world have shown a pattern of convergence, in

which their economies grow faster than those of high-income countries. GDP increased by an average rate of

2.7% per year in the 1990s and 1.7% per year from 2010 to 2019 in the high-income countries of the world,

which include the United States, Canada, the European Union countries, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.

Table 7.5 lists eight countries that belong to an informal “fast growth club.” These countries averaged GDP

growth (after adjusting for inflation) of at least 5% per year in both the time periods from 1990 to 2000 and

from 2010 to 2019. Since economic growth in these countries has exceeded the average of the world’s high-

income economies, these countries may converge with the high-income countries. The second part of Table

7.5 lists the “slow growth club,” which consists of countries that averaged GDP growth of 2% per year or less

(after adjusting for inflation) during the same time periods. The final portion of Table 7.5 shows GDP growth

rates for the countries of the world divided by income.

TABLE 7.5 Economic Growth around the World (Source: http://databank.worldbank.org/data/views/

variableSelection/selectvariables.aspx?source=world-development-indicators#c_u)

Each of the countries in Table 7.5 has its own unique story of investments in human and physical capital,

technological gains, market forces, government policies, and even lucky events, but an overall pattern of

convergence is clear. The low-income countries have GDP growth that is faster than that of the middle-income

countries, which in turn have GDP growth that is faster than that of the high-income countries. Two prominent

members of the fast-growth club are China and India, which between them have nearly 40% of the world’s

population. Some prominent members of the slow-growth club are high-income countries like France,

Germany, Italy, and Japan.

Will this pattern of economic convergence persist into the future? This is a controversial question among

economists that we will consider by looking at some of the main arguments on both sides.

Arguments Favoring Convergence

Several arguments suggest that low-income countries might have an advantage in achieving greater worker

productivity and economic growth in the future.

A first argument is based on diminishing marginal returns. Even though deepening human and physical

capital will tend to increase GDP per capita, the law of diminishing returns suggests that as an economy

continues to increase its human and physical capital, the marginal gains to economic growth will diminish. For

example, raising the average education level of the population by two years from a tenth-grade level to a high

school diploma (while holding all other inputs constant) would produce a certain increase in output. An

additional two-year increase, so that the average person had a two-year college degree, would increase output

further, but the marginal gain would be smaller. Yet another additional two-year increase in the level of

education, so that the average person would have a four-year-college bachelor’s degree, would increase output

still further, but the marginal increase would again be smaller. A similar lesson holds for physical capital. If the

quantity of physical capital available to the average worker increases, by, say, $5,000 to $10,000 (again, while

holding all other inputs constant), it will increase the level of output. An additional increase from $10,000 to

$15,000 will increase output further, but the marginal increase will be smaller.

Low-income countries like China and India tend to have lower levels of human capital and physical capital, so

an investment in capital deepening should have a larger marginal effect in these countries than in high-

Access for free at openstax.org

7.4 • Economic Convergence 183

income countries, where levels of human and physical capital are already relatively high. Diminishing returns

implies that low-income economies could converge to the levels that the high-income countries achieve.

A second argument is that low-income countries may find it easier to improve their technologies than high-

income countries. High-income countries must continually invent new technologies, whereas low-income

countries can often find ways of applying technology that has already been invented and is well understood.

The economist Alexander Gerschenkron (1904–1978) gave this phenomenon a memorable name: “the

advantages of backwardness.” Of course, he did not literally mean that it is an advantage to have a lower

standard of living. He was pointing out that a country that is behind has some extra potential for catching up.

Finally, optimists argue that many countries have observed the experience of those that have grown more

quickly and have learned from it. Moreover, once the people of a country begin to enjoy the benefits of a higher

standard of living, they may be more likely to build and support the market-friendly institutions that will help

provide this standard of living.

Arguments That Convergence Is neither Inevitable nor Likely

If the economy's growth depended only on the deepening of human capital and physical capital, then we would

expect that economy's growth rate to slow down over the long run because of diminishing marginal returns.

However, there is another crucial factor in the aggregate production function: technology.

Developing new technology can provide a way for an economy to sidestep the diminishing marginal returns of

capital deepening. Figure 7.7 shows how. The figure's horizontal axis measures the amount of capital

deepening, which on this figure is an overall measure that includes deepening of both physical and human
capital. The amount of human and physical capital per worker increases as you move from left to right, from C1
to C2 to C3. The diagram's vertical axis measures per capita output. Start by considering the lowest line in this
diagram, labeled Technology 1. Along this aggregate production function, the level of technology is held

constant, so the line shows only the relationship between capital deepening and output. As capital deepens
from C1 to C2 to C3 and the economy moves from R to U to W, per capita output does increase—but the way in
which the line starts out steeper on the left but then flattens as it moves to the right shows the diminishing

marginal returns, as additional marginal amounts of capital deepening increase output by ever-smaller

amounts. The shape of the aggregate production line (Technology 1) shows that the ability of capital

deepening, by itself, to generate sustained economic growth is limited, since diminishing returns will

eventually set in.

FIGURE 7.7 Capital Deepening and New Technology Imagine that the economy starts at point R, with the level of
physical and human capital C1 and the output per capita at G1. If the economy relies only on capital deepening,
while remaining at the technology level shown by the Technology 1 line, then it would face diminishing marginal

184 7 • Economic Growth

returns as it moved from point R to point U to point W. However, now imagine that capital deepening is combined
with improvements in technology. Then, as capital deepens from C1 to C2, technology improves from Technology 1
to Technology 2, and the economy moves from R to S. Similarly, as capital deepens from C2 to C3, technology
increases from Technology 2 to Technology 3, and the economy moves from S to T. With improvements in

technology, there is no longer any reason that economic growth must necessarily slow down.

Now, bring improvements in technology into the picture. Improved technology means that with a given set of

inputs, more output is possible. The production function labeled Technology 1 in the figure is based on one

level of technology, but Technology 2 is based on an improved level of technology, so for every level of capital

deepening on the horizontal axis, it produces a higher level of output on the vertical axis. In turn, production

function Technology 3 represents a still higher level of technology, so that for every level of inputs on the

horizontal axis, it produces a higher level of output on the vertical axis than either of the other two aggregate

production functions.

Most healthy, growing economies are deepening their human and physical capital and increasing technology

at the same time. As a result, the economy can move from a choice like point R on the Technology 1 aggregate

production line to a point like S on Technology 2 and a point like T on the still higher aggregate production line
(Technology 3). With the combination of technology and capital deepening, the rise in GDP per capita in high-
income countries does not need to fade away because of diminishing returns. The gains from technology can

offset the diminishing returns involved with capital deepening.

Will technological improvements themselves run into diminishing returns over time? That is, will it become

continually harder and more costly to discover new technological improvements? Perhaps someday, but, at

least over the last two centuries since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, improvements in technology

have not run into diminishing marginal returns. Modern inventions, like the internet or discoveries in genetics

or materials science, do not seem to provide smaller gains to output than earlier inventions like the steam

engine or the railroad. One reason that technological ideas do not seem to run into diminishing returns is that

we often can apply widely the ideas of new technology at a marginal cost that is very low or even zero. A

specific worker or group of workers must use a specific additional machine, or an additional year of education.

Many workers across the economy can use a new technology or invention at very low marginal cost.

The argument that it is easier for a low-income country to copy and adapt existing technology than it is for a

high-income country to invent new technology is not necessarily true, either. When it comes to adapting and

using new technology, a society’s performance is not necessarily guaranteed, but is the result of whether the

country's economic, educational, and public policy institutions are supportive. In theory, perhaps, low-income

countries have many opportunities to copy and adapt technology, but if they lack the appropriate supportive

economic infrastructure and institutions, the theoretical possibility that backwardness might have certain

advantages is of little practical relevance.

The Slowness of Convergence

Although economic convergence between the high-income countries and the rest of the world seems possible

and even likely, it will proceed slowly. Consider, for example, a country that starts off with a GDP per capita of

$40,000, which would roughly represent a typical high-income country today, and another country that starts

out at $4,000, which is roughly the level in low-income but not impoverished countries like Indonesia,

Guatemala, or Egypt. Say that the rich country chugs along at a 2% annual growth rate of GDP per capita, while

the poorer country grows at the aggressive rate of 7% per year. After 30 years, GDP per capita in the rich
country will be $72,450 (that is, $40,000 (1 + 0.02)30) while in the poor country it will be $30,450 (that is,
$4,000 (1 + 0.07)30). Convergence has occurred. The rich country used to be 10 times as wealthy as the poor

Access for free at openstax.org

7.4 • Economic Convergence 185

one, and now it is only about 2.4 times as wealthy. Even after 30 consecutive years of very rapid growth,

however, people in the low-income country are still likely to feel quite poor compared to people in the rich

country. Moreover, as the poor country catches up, its opportunities for catch-up growth are reduced, and its

growth rate may slow down somewhat.

The slowness of convergence illustrates again that small differences in annual rates of economic growth

become huge differences over time. The high-income countries have been building up their advantage in

standard of living over decades—more than a century in some cases. Even in an optimistic scenario, it will take

decades for the low-income countries of the world to catch up significantly.

BRING IT HOME

Calories and Economic Growth
We can tell the story of modern economic growth by looking at calorie consumption over time. The dramatic rise in

incomes allowed the average person to eat better and consume more calories. How did these incomes increase?

The neoclassical growth consensus uses the aggregate production function to suggest that the period of modern

economic growth came about because of increases in inputs such as technology and physical and human capital.

Also important was the way in which technological progress combined with physical and human capital deepening

to create growth and convergence. The issue of distribution of income notwithstanding, it is clear that the average

worker can afford more calories in 2020 than in 1875.

Aside from increases in income, there is another reason why the average person can afford more food. Modern

agriculture has allowed many countries to produce more food than they need. Despite having more than enough

food, however, many governments and multilateral agencies have not solved the food distribution problem. In fact,

food shortages, famine, or general food insecurity are caused more often by the failure of government

macroeconomic policy, according to the Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen. Sen has conducted extensive

research into issues of inequality, poverty, and the role of government in improving standards of living.

Macroeconomic policies that strive toward stable inflation, full employment, education of women, and preservation

of property rights are more likely to eliminate starvation and provide for a more even distribution of food.

Because we have more food per capita, global food prices have decreased since 1875. The prices of some foods,

however, have decreased more than the prices of others. For example, researchers from the University of

Washington have shown that in the United States, calories from zucchini and lettuce are 100 times more expensive

than calories from oil, butter, and sugar. Research from countries like India, China, and the United States suggests

that as incomes rise, individuals want more calories from fats and protein and fewer from carbohydrates. This has

very interesting implications for global food production, obesity, and environmental consequences. Affluent urban

India has an obesity problem much like many parts of the United States. The forces of convergence are at work.

Key Concepts and Summary

7.1 The Relatively Recent Arrival of Economic Growth

Since the early nineteenth century, there has been a spectacular process of long-run economic growth during

which the world’s leading economies—mostly those in Western Europe and North America—expanded GDP per

capita at an average rate of about 2% per year. In the last half-century, countries like Japan, South Korea, and

China have shown the potential to catch up. The Industrial Revolution facilitated the extensive process of

economic growth, that economists often refer to as modern economic growth. This increased worker

productivity and trade, as well as the development of governance and market institutions.

7.2 Labor Productivity and Economic Growth

We can measure productivity, the value of what is produced per worker, or per hour worked, as the level of GDP

per worker or GDP per hour. The United States experienced a productivity slowdown between 1973 and 1989.

Since then, U.S. productivity has rebounded for the most part, but annual growth in productivity in the

nonfarm business sector has been less than one percent each year between 2011 and 2016. It is not clear what

productivity growth will be in the coming years. The rate of productivity growth is the primary determinant of

an economy’s rate of long-term economic growth and higher wages. Over decades and generations, seemingly

small differences of a few percentage points in the annual rate of economic growth make an enormous

difference in GDP per capita. An aggregate production function specifies how certain inputs in the economy,

like human capital, physical capital, and technology, lead to the output measured as GDP per capita.

Compound interest and compound growth rates behave in the same way as productivity rates. Seemingly

small changes in percentage points can have big impacts on income over time.

7.3 Components of Economic Growth

Over decades and generations, seemingly small differences of a few percentage points in the annual rate of

economic growth make an enormous difference in GDP per capita. Capital deepening refers to an increase in

the amount of capital per worker, either human capital per worker, in the form of higher education or skills, or

physical capital per worker. Technology, in its economic meaning, refers broadly to all new methods of

production, which includes major scientific inventions but also small inventions and even better forms of

management or other types of institutions. A healthy climate for growth in GDP per capita consists of

improvements in human capital, physical capital, and technology, in a market-oriented environment with

supportive public policies and institutions.

7.4 Economic Convergence

When countries with lower GDP levels per capita catch up to countries with higher GDP levels per capita, we

call the process convergence. Convergence can occur even when both high- and low-income countries increase

investment in physical and human capital with the objective of growing GDP. This is because the impact of new
investment in physical and human capital on a low-income country may result in huge gains as new skills or

equipment combine with the labor force. In higher-income countries, however, a level of investment equal to

that of the low income country is not likely to have as big an impact, because the more developed country most

likely already has high levels of capital investment. Therefore, the marginal gain from this additional

investment tends to be successively less and less. Higher income countries are more likely to have diminishing

returns to their investments and must continually invent new technologies. This allows lower-income

economies to have a chance for convergent growth. However, many high-income economies have developed

economic and political institutions that provide a healthy economic climate for an ongoing stream of

technological innovations. Continuous technological innovation can counterbalance diminishing returns to

investments in human and physical capital.

Introduction to Unemployment

BRING IT HOME

Unemployment and the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Complicated Story
It was the most abrupt economic change in the post-World War II era. Between March 2020 and April 2020, the

U.S. unemployment rate increased from 4.4% to 14.8%. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of people

were left without work as businesses shut down and people stayed home and cut their spending, especially on

restaurants, tourism, and travel. As confidence and spending were slowly restored, and as the situation with the

virus steadily improved, unemployment began to tick down. By 2022, with the availability of vaccines and boosters

and other improved health measures, things were better still, but the presence of dangerous variants prevented a

full return to normal.

192 8 • Unemployment

The COVID-19 pandemic had other effects on the labor market as well. Labor force participation—the rate at which

people are employed or actively searching for work—declined and as of early-2022 remained lower than it was in

2019. Some were forced to stop working because of school and childcare closures. Others were concerned about

how safe their workplaces would be in the middle of a global pandemic. And still others simply chose to retire early.

Labor force participation remains a sore spot in the labor market's recovery.

These two statistics—unemployment and labor force participation—show how complicated the labor market can be.

As the unemployment rate declined through 2021, the disappointing statistics on labor force participation show

weak points. One day you may have read a headline about how easy it was to find a job, and the next day a headline

would describe how difficult it was for employers to find workers. By the end of this chapter, you will be in a much

better position to make sense of these events.

Unemployment can be a terrible and wrenching life experience—like a serious automobile accident or a messy

divorce—whose consequences only someone who has gone through it can fully understand. For unemployed

individuals and their families, there is the day-to-day financial stress of not knowing from where the next

paycheck is coming. There are painful adjustments, like watching your savings account dwindle, selling a car

and buying a cheaper one, or moving to a less expensive place to live. Even when the unemployed person finds
a new job, it may pay less than the previous one. For many people, their job is an important part of their self

worth. When unemployment separates people from the workforce, it can affect family relationships as well as

mental and physical health.

The human costs of unemployment alone would justify making a low level of unemployment an important

public policy priority. However, unemployment also includes economic costs to the broader society. When

millions of unemployed but willing workers cannot find jobs, economic resource are unused. An economy with

high unemployment is like a company operating with a functional but unused factory. The opportunity cost of

unemployment is the output that the unemployed workers could have produced.

This chapter will discuss how economists define and compute the unemployment rate. It will examine the

patterns of unemployment over time, for the U.S. economy as a whole, for different demographic groups in the

U.S. economy, and for other countries. It will then consider an economic explanation for unemployment, and

how it explains the patterns of unemployment and suggests public policies for reducing it.

8.1 How Economists Define and Compute Unemployment Rate

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Calculate the labor force participation rate and the unemployment rate

• Explain hidden unemployment and what it means to be in or out of the labor force

• Evaluate the collection and interpretation of unemployment data

Newspaper or television reports typically describe unemployment as a percentage or a rate. A recent report

might have said, for example, from September 2021 to October 2021, the U.S. unemployment rate declined

from 4.8% to 4.6%. At a glance, the changes between the percentages may seem small. However, remember

that the U.S. economy has about 162 million adults (as of the beginning of 2022) who either have jobs or are

looking for them. A rise or fall of just 0.1% in the unemployment rate of 162 million potential workers

translates into 160,000 people, which is roughly the total population of a city like Syracuse, New York,

Brownsville, Texas, or Pasadena, California. Large rises in the unemployment rate mean large numbers of job

losses. In April 2020, at the peak of the pandemic-induced recession, over 20 million people were out of work.

Even with the unemployment rate at 4.2% in November 2021, about 7 million people who were looking for jobs

were out of work.

8.1 • How Economists Define and Compute Unemployment Rate 193

LINK IT UP

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (http://openstax.org/l/BLS1) tracks and reports all data related to

unemployment.

Who’s In or Out of the Labor Force?

Should we count everyone without a job as unemployed? Of course not. For example, we should not count

children as unemployed. Surely, we should not count the retired as unemployed. Many full-time college

students have only a part-time job, or no job at all, but it seems inappropriate to count them as suffering the

pains of unemployment. Some people are not working because they are rearing children, ill, on vacation, or on

parental leave.

The point is that we do not just divide the adult population into employed and unemployed. A third group

exists: people who do not have a job, and for some reason—retirement, looking after children, taking a

voluntary break before a new job—are not interested in having a job, either. It also includes those who do want

a job but have quit looking, often due to discouragement due to their inability to find suitable employment.

Economists refer to this third group of those who are not working and not looking for work as out of the labor

force or not in the labor force.

The U.S. unemployment rate, which is based on a monthly survey carried out by the U.S. Bureau of the Census,

asks a series of questions to divide the adult population into employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force.

To be classified as unemployed, a person must be without a job, currently available to work, and actively

looking for work in the previous four weeks. Thus, a person who does not have a job but who is not currently

available to work or has not actively looked for work in the last four weeks is counted as out of the labor force.

Employed: currently working for pay

Unemployed: Out of work and actively looking for a job

Out of the labor force: Out of paid work and not actively looking for a job

Labor force: the number of employed plus the unemployed

Calculating the Unemployment Rate

Figure 8.2 shows the three-way division of the 16-and-over population. In January 2017, about 62.9% of the

adult population was "in the labor force"; that is, people are either employed or without a job but looking for

work. We can divide those in the labor force into the employed and the unemployed. Table 8.1 shows those

values. The unemployment rate is not the percentage of the total adult population without jobs, but rather the

percentage of adults who are in the labor force but who do not have jobs:

194 8 • Unemployment

FIGURE 8.2 Employed, Unemployed, and Out of the Labor Force Distribution of Adult Population (age 16 and older),

population, 155.175 million were classified as employed, and 6.877 million were classified as unemployed. The

remaining 99.977 million were classified as out of the labor force. As you will learn, however, this seemingly simple

chart does not tell the whole story. As you will learn, however, this seemingly simple chart does not tell the whole

TABLE 8.1 U.S. Employment and Unemployment, November 2021

(Source: https://data.bls.gov)

In this example, we can calculate the unemployment rate as 7.635 million unemployed people divided by

159.716 million people in the labor force, which works out to a 4.8% rate of unemployment. The following

Work It Out feature will walk you through the steps of this calculation.

Calculating Labor Force Percentages
How do economists arrive at the percentages in and out of the labor force and the unemployment rate? We will

use the values in Table 8.1 to illustrate the steps.

To determine the percentage in the labor force:

Step 1. Divide the number of people in the labor force (159.716 million) by the total adult (working-age)

population (254.082 million).

Step 2. Multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage.

8.1 • How Economists Define and Compute Unemployment Rate 195

To determine the percentage out of the labor force:

Step 1. Divide the number of people out the labor force (94.366 million) by the total adult (working-age)

population (254.082 million).

Step 2. Multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage.

To determine the unemployment rate:

Step 1. Divide the number of unemployed people (7.635 million) by the total labor force (157 million).

Step 2. Multiply by 100 to obtain the rate.

Hidden Unemployment

Even with the “out of the labor force” category, there are still some people who are mislabeled in the

categorization of employed, unemployed, or out of the labor force. There are some people who have only part

time or temporary jobs, and they are looking for full time and permanent employment that are counted as

employed, although they are not employed in the way they would like or need to be. Additionally, there are

individuals who are underemployed. This includes those who are trained or skilled for one type or level of

work but are working in a lower paying job or one that does not utilize their skills. For example, we would

consider an individual with a college degree in finance who is working as a sales clerk underemployed. They

are, however, also counted in the employed group. All of these individuals fall under the umbrella of the term

“hidden unemployment.” Discouraged workers, those who have stopped looking for employment and, hence,

are no longer counted in the unemployed also fall into this group

Labor Force Participation Rate

Another important statistic is the labor force participation rate. This is the percentage of adults in an

economy who are either employed or who are unemployed and looking for a job. Using the data in Figure 8.2

and Table 8.1, those included in this calculation would be the 162.052 million individuals in the labor force.

We calculate the rate by taking the number of people in the labor force, that is, the number employed and the

number unemployed, divided by the total adult population and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage. For

the data from November 2021, the labor force participation rate is 61.8%. Historically, the civilian labor force

participation rate in the United States climbed beginning in the 1960s as women increasingly entered the

workforce, and it peaked at just over 67% in late 1999 to early 2000. Since then, the labor force participation

rate has steadily declined, slowly to about 66% in 2008, early in the Great Recession, and then more rapidly

during and after that recession. The labor force then climbed slowly during the 2010s but declined again

during the pandemic in March–April 2020 and remained lower than pre-pandemic levels as of early 2022.

196 8 • Unemployment

The Establishment Payroll Survey

When the unemployment report comes out each month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) also reports on

the number of jobs created—which comes from the establishment payroll survey. The payroll survey is based

on a survey of about 147,000 businesses and government agencies throughout the United States. It generates

payroll employment estimates by the following criteria: all employees, average weekly hours worked, and

average hourly, weekly, and overtime earnings. One of the criticisms of this survey is that it does not count the

self-employed. It also does not make a distinction between new, minimum wage, part time or temporary jobs

and full time jobs with “decent” pay.

How Does the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Collect the U.S. Unemployment Data?

The unemployment rate announced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on the first Friday of each month for

the previous month is based on the Current Population Survey (CPS), which the Bureau has carried out every

month since 1940. The Bureau takes great care to make this survey representative of the country as a whole.

The country is first divided into 3,137 areas. The U.S. Bureau of the Census then selects 729 of these areas to

survey. It divides the 729 areas into districts of about 300 households each, and divides each district into

clusters of about four dwelling units. Every month, Census Bureau employees call about 15,000 of the four-

household clusters, for a total of 60,000 households. Employees interview households for four consecutive

months, then rotate them out of the survey for eight months, and then interview them again for the same four

months the following year, before leaving the sample permanently.

Based on this survey, state, industry, urban and rural areas, gender, age, race or ethnicity, and level of

education statistics comprise components that contribute to unemployment rates. A wide variety of other

information is available, too. For example, how long have people been unemployed? Did they become

unemployed because they quit, or were laid off, or their employer went out of business? Is the unemployed

person the only wage earner in the family? The Current Population Survey is a treasure trove of information

about employment and unemployment. If you are wondering what the difference is between the CPS and EPS,

read the following Clear it Up feature.

CLEAR IT UP

What is the difference between CPS and EPS?
The United States Census Bureau conducts the Current Population Survey (CPS), which measures the percentage of

the labor force that is unemployed. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' establishment payroll survey (EPS) is a payroll

survey that measures the net change in jobs created for the month.

Criticisms of Measuring Unemployment

There are always complications in measuring the number of unemployed. For example, what about people

who do not have jobs and would be available to work, but are discouraged by the lack of available jobs in their

area and stopped looking? Such people, and their families, may be suffering the pains of unemployment.

However, the survey counts them as out of the labor force because they are not actively looking for work. Other

people may tell the Census Bureau that they are ready to work and looking for a job but, truly, they are not that

eager to work and are not looking very hard at all. They are counted as unemployed, although they might more

accurately be classified as out of the labor force. Still other people may have a job, perhaps doing something

like yard work, child care, or cleaning houses, but are not reporting the income earned to the tax authorities.

They may report being unemployed, when they actually are working.

Although the unemployment rate gets most of the public and media attention, economic researchers at the

Bureau of Labor Statistics publish a wide array of surveys and reports that try to measure these kinds of issues

and to develop a more nuanced and complete view of the labor market. It is not exactly a hot news flash that

economic statistics are imperfect. Even imperfect measures like the unemployment rate, however, can still be

8.2 Patterns of Unemployment

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain historical patterns of unemployment in the U.S.

•

Identify trends of unemployment based on demographics

• Evaluate global unemployment rates

Let’s look at how unemployment rates have changed over time and how various groups of people are affected

by unemployment differently.

The Historical U.S. Unemployment Rate

Figure 8.3 shows the historical pattern of U.S. unemployment since 1955.

FIGURE 8.3 The U.S. Unemployment Rate, 1948–2020 The U.S. unemployment rate moves up and down as the

economy moves in and out of recessions. However, over time, the unemployment rate seems to return to a range of

4% to 6%. There does not seem to be a long-term trend toward the rate moving generally higher or generally lower.

(Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/LRUN64TTUSA156S0)

As we look at this data, several patterns stand out:

1. Unemployment rates do fluctuate over time. During the deep recessions of the early 1980s, 2007–2009,

and 2021, unemployment reached roughly 10%. For comparison, during the 1930s Great Depression, the

unemployment rate reached almost 25% of the labor force.

2. Unemployment rates in the late 1990s and into the mid-2000s were rather low by historical standards.

The unemployment rate was below 5% from 1997 to 2000, and near 5% during almost all of 2006–2007,

and 5% or less from September 2015 through March 2020. The previous time unemployment had been

less than 5% for three consecutive years was three decades earlier, from 1968 to 1970.

3. The unemployment rate never falls all the way to zero. It almost never seems to get below 3%—and it stays

that low only for very short periods. (We discuss reasons why this is the case later in this chapter.)

4. The timing of rises and falls in unemployment matches fairly well with the timing of upswings and

198 8 • Unemployment

downswings in the overall economy, except that unemployment tends to lag changes in economic activity,

and especially so during upswings of the economy following a recession. During periods of recession and

depression, unemployment is high. During periods of economic growth, unemployment tends to be lower.

5. No significant upward or downward trend in unemployment rates is apparent. This point is especially

worth noting because the U.S. population more than quadrupled from 76 million in 1900 to over 324

million by 2017. Moreover, a higher proportion of U.S. adults are now in the paid workforce, because

women have entered the paid labor force in significant numbers in recent decades. Women comprised

18% of the paid workforce in 1900 and nearly half of the paid workforce in 2021. However, despite the

increased number of workers, as well as other economic events like globalization and the continuous

invention of new technologies, the economy has provided jobs without causing any long-term upward or

downward trend in unemployment rates.

Unemployment Rate from 1948. Similar to the graph in the figure above, the rate moves up and down as the

economy moves in and out of recessions.

Unemployment Rates by Group

Unemployment is not distributed evenly across the U.S. population. Figure 8.4 shows unemployment rates

broken down in various ways: by gender, age, and race/ethnicity.

8.2 • Patterns of Unemployment 199

FIGURE 8.4 Unemployment Rate by Demographic Group (a) By gender, 1948–2020. Unemployment rates for men

used to be lower than unemployment rates for women, but in recent decades, the two rates have been very close,

often– and especially during and soon after the Great Recession – with the unemployment rate for men somewhat

higher. (b) By age, 1948–2020. Unemployment rates are highest for the very young and become lower with age. (c)

By race and ethnicity, 1974–2020. Although unemployment rates for all groups tend to rise and fall together, the

unemployment rate for Black people is typically about twice as high as that for White people, while the

unemployment rate for Hispanic people is in between. (Source: www.bls.gov)

The unemployment rate for women had historically tended to be higher than the unemployment rate for men,

perhaps reflecting the historical pattern that women were seen as “secondary” earners. By about 1980,

however, the unemployment rate for women was essentially the same as that for men, as Figure 8.4 (a) shows.

During the pandemic-induced recession of 2020 and in the immediate aftermath, the unemployment rate for

women exceeded the unemployment rate for men. Subsequently, however, the gap has narrowed.

200 8 • Unemployment

LINK IT UP

Read this report (http://openstax.org/l/BLS_recession) for detailed information on the 2008–2009 recession. It

also provides some very useful information on the statistics of unemployment.

Younger workers tend to have higher unemployment, while middle-aged workers tend to have lower

unemployment, probably because the middle-aged workers feel the responsibility of needing to have a job

more heavily. Younger workers move in and out of jobs more than middle-aged workers, as part of the process

of matching of workers and jobs, and this contributes to their higher unemployment rates. In addition, middle-

aged workers are more likely to feel the responsibility of needing to have a job more heavily. Elderly workers

have extremely low rates of unemployment, because those who do not have jobs often exit the labor force by

retiring, and thus are not counted in the unemployment statistics. Figure 8.4 (b) shows unemployment rates

for women divided by age. The pattern for men is similar.

The unemployment rate for African-Americans is substantially higher than the rate for other racial or ethnic

groups, a fact that surely reflects, to some extent, a pattern of discrimination that has constrained Black

people’s labor market opportunities. However, the gaps between unemployment rates for White, Black, and

Hispanic people have diminished in the 1990s, as Figure 8.4 (c) shows. In fact, unemployment rates for Black

and Hispanic people were at the lowest levels for several decades in the mid-2000s before rising during the

recent Great Recession.

Finally, those with less education typically suffer higher unemployment. In November 2021, for example, the

unemployment rate for those with a college degree was 2.3%; for those with some college but not a four year

degree, the unemployment rate was 3.7%; for high school graduates with no additional degree, the

unemployment rate was 5.2%; and for those without a high school diploma, the unemployment rate was 5.7%.

This pattern arises because additional education typically offers better connections to the labor market and

higher demand. With less attractive labor market opportunities for low-skilled workers compared to the

opportunities for the more highly-skilled, including lower pay, low-skilled workers may be less motivated to

find jobs.

Breaking Down Unemployment in Other Ways

International Unemployment Comparisons

From an international perspective, the U.S. unemployment rate typically has looked a little better than average.

Table 8.4 compares unemployment rates for 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006 (just before the Great Recession), and

2019 (just before the pandemic-induced recession) from several other high-income countries.

TABLE 8.4 International Comparisons of Unemployment

Rates

However, we need to treat cross-country comparisons of unemployment rates with care, because each country

has slightly different definitions of unemployment, survey tools for measuring unemployment, and also

different labor markets. For example, Japan’s unemployment rates appear quite low, but Japan’s economy has

been mired in slow growth and recession since the late 1980s, and Japan’s unemployment rate probably paints

too rosy a picture of its labor market. In Japan, workers who lose their jobs are often quick to exit the labor

force and not look for a new job, in which case they are not counted as unemployed. In addition, Japanese

firms are often quite reluctant to fire workers, and so firms have substantial numbers of workers who are on

reduced hours or officially employed, but doing very little. We can view this Japanese pattern as an unusual

202 8 • Unemployment

method for society to provide support for the unemployed, rather than a sign of a healthy economy.

We hear about the Chinese economy in the news all the time. The value of the Chinese yuan in comparison to

the U.S. dollar is likely to be part of the nightly business report, so why is the Chinese economy not included in

this discussion of international unemployment? The lack of reliable statistics is the reason. This article

(http://openstax.org/l/ChinaEmployment) explains why.

Comparing unemployment rates in the United States and other high-income economies with unemployment

rates in Latin America, Africa, Eastern Europe, and Asia is very difficult. One reason is that the statistical

agencies in many poorer countries lack the resources and technical capabilities of the U.S. Bureau of the

Census. However, a more difficult problem with international comparisons is that in many low-income

countries, most workers are not involved in the labor market through an employer who pays them regularly.

Instead, workers in these countries are engaged in short-term work, subsistence activities, and barter.

Moreover, the effect of unemployment is very different in high-income and low-income countries. Unemployed

workers in the developed economies have access to various government programs like unemployment

insurance, welfare, and food stamps. Such programs may barely exist in poorer countries. Although

unemployment is a serious problem in many low-income countries, it manifests itself in a different way than

in high-income countries.

8.3 What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Short Run

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Analyze cyclical unemployment

• Explain the relationship between sticky wages and employment using various economic arguments

• Apply supply and demand models to unemployment and wages

We have seen that unemployment varies across times and places. What causes changes in unemployment?

There are different answers in the short run and in the long run. Let's look at the short run first.

Cyclical Unemployment

Let’s make the plausible assumption that in the short run, from a few months to a few years, the quantity of

hours that the average person is willing to work for a given wage does not change much, so the labor supply

curve does not shift much. In addition, make the standard ceteris paribusassumption that there is no

substantial short-term change in the age structure of the labor force, institutions and laws affecting the labor
market, or other possibly relevant factors.

One primary determinant of the demand for labor from firms is how they perceive the state of the macro

economy. If firms believe that business is expanding, then at any given wage they will desire to hire a greater

quantity of labor, and the labor demand curve shifts to the right. Conversely, if firms perceive that the economy

is slowing down or entering a recession, then they will wish to hire a lower quantity of labor at any given wage,

and the labor demand curve will shift to the left. Economists call the variation in unemployment that the

economy causes moving from expansion to recession or from recession to expansion (i.e. the business cycle)

cyclical unemployment.

From the standpoint of the supply-and-demand model of competitive and flexible labor markets,

unemployment represents something of a puzzle. In a supply-and-demand model of a labor market, as Figure

8.5 illustrates, the labor market should move toward an equilibrium wage and quantity. At the equilibrium

wage (We), the equilibrium quantity (Qe) of labor supplied by workers should be equal to the quantity of labor

demanded by employers.

8.3 • What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Short Run 203

FIGURE 8.5 The Unemployment and Equilibrium in the Labor Market In a labor market with flexible wages, the

equilibrium will occur at wage We and quantity Qe, where the number of people who want jobs (shown by S) equals

the number of jobs available (shown by D).

One possibility for unemployment is that people who are unemployed are those who are not willing to work at

the current equilibrium wage, say $10 an hour, but would be willing to work at a higher wage, like $20 per hour.

The monthly Current Population Survey would count these people as unemployed, because they say they are

ready and looking for work (at $20 per hour). However, from an economist’s perspective, these people are

choosing to be unemployed.

Probably a few people are unemployed because of unrealistic expectations about wages, but they do not

represent the majority of the unemployed. Instead, unemployed people often have friends or acquaintances of

similar skill levels who are employed, and the unemployed would be willing to work at the jobs and wages

similar to what those people are receiving. However, the employers of their friends and acquaintances do not

seem to be hiring. In other words, these people are involuntarily unemployed. What causes involuntary

unemployment?

Why Wages Might Be Sticky Downward

If a labor market model with flexible wages does not describe unemployment very well—because it predicts

that anyone willing to work at the going wage can always find a job—then it may prove useful to consider

economic models in which wages are not flexible or adjust only very slowly. In particular, even though wage

increases may occur with relative ease, wage decreases are few and far between.

One set of reasons why wages may be “sticky downward,” as economists put it, involves economic laws and

institutions. For low-skilled workers receiving minimum wage, it is illegal to reduce their wages. For union

workers operating under a multiyear contract with a company, wage cuts might violate the contract and create

a labor dispute or a strike. However, minimum wages and union contracts are not a sufficient reason why

wages would be sticky downward for the U.S. economy as a whole. After all, out of the 73.3 million or so

employed workers in the U.S. economy who earn wages by the hour, only about 1.1 million—less than 2% of the

total—do not receive compensation above the minimum wage. Similarly, labor unions represent only about

12% of American wage and salary workers. In other high-income countries, more workers may have their

wages determined by unions or the minimum wage may be set at a level that applies to a larger share of

workers. However, for the United States, these two factors combined affect only about 15% or less of the labor

force.

Economists looking for reasons why wages might be sticky downwards have focused on factors that may

characterize most labor relationships in the economy, not just a few. Many have proposed a number of

different theories, but they share a common tone.

204 8 • Unemployment

One argument is that even employees who are not union members often work under an implicit contract,

which is that the employer will try to keep wages from falling when the economy is weak or the business is

having trouble, and the employee will not expect huge salary increases when the economy or the business is

strong. This wage-setting behavior acts like a form of insurance: the employee has some protection against

wage declines in bad times, but pays for that protection with lower wages in good times. Clearly, this sort of

implicit contract means that firms will be hesitant to cut wages, lest workers feel betrayed and work less hard

or even leave the firm.

Efficiency wage theory argues that workers' productivity depends on their pay, and so employers will often

find it worthwhile to pay their employees somewhat more than market conditions might dictate. One reason is

that employees who receive better pay than others will be more productive because they recognize that if they

were to lose their current jobs, they would suffer a decline in salary. As a result, they are motivated to work

harder and to stay with the current employer. In addition, employers know that it is costly and time-consuming

to hire and train new employees, so they would prefer to pay workers a little extra now rather than to lose them

and have to hire and train new workers. Thus, by avoiding wage cuts, the employer minimizes costs of training

and hiring new workers, and reaps the benefits of well-motivated employees.

The adverse selection of wage cuts argument points out that if an employer reacts to poor business
conditions by reducing wages for all workers, then the best workers, those with the best employment

alternatives at other firms, are the most likely to leave. The least attractive workers, with fewer employment

alternatives, are more likely to stay. Consequently, firms are more likely to choose which workers should

depart, through layoffs and firings, rather than trimming wages across the board. Sometimes companies that

are experiencing difficult times can persuade workers to take a pay cut for the short term, and still retain most

of the firm’s workers. However, it is far more typical for companies to lay off some workers, rather than to cut

wages for everyone.

The insider-outsider model of the labor force, in simple terms, argues that those already working for firms are

“insiders,” while new employees, at least for a time, are “outsiders.” A firm depends on its insiders to keep the

organization running smoothly, to be familiar with routine procedures, and to train new employees. However,

cutting wages will alienate the insiders and damage the firm’s productivity and prospects.

Finally, the relative wage coordination argument points out that even if most workers were hypothetically

willing to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experiences

such a decline, there is no obvious way for a decentralized economy to implement such a plan. Instead,

workers confronted with the possibility of a wage cut will worry that other workers will not have such a wage

cut, and so a wage cut means being worse off both in absolute terms and relative to others. As a result, workers

fight hard against wage cuts.

These theories of why wages tend not to move downward differ in their logic and their implications, and

figuring out the strengths and weaknesses of each theory is an ongoing subject of research and controversy

among economists. All tend to imply that wages will decline only very slowly, if at all, even when the economy

or a business is having tough times. When wages are inflexible and unlikely to fall, then either short-run or

long-run unemployment can result. Figure 8.6 illustrates this.

8.3 • What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Short Run 205

FIGURE 8.6 Sticky Wages in the Labor Market Because the wage rate is stuck at W, above the equilibrium, the

number of those who want jobs (Qs) is greater than the number of job openings (Qd). The result is unemployment,

shown by the bracket in the figure.

Figure 8.7 shows the interaction between shifts in labor demand and wages that are sticky downward. Figure
8.7 (a) illustrates the situation in which the demand for labor shifts to the right from D0 to D1. In this case, the
equilibrium wage rises from W0 to W1 and the equilibrium quantity of labor hired increases from Q0 to Q1. It
does not hurt employee morale at all for wages to rise.

Figure 8.7 (b) shows the situation in which the demand for labor shifts to the left, from D0 to D1, as it would
tend to do in a recession. Because wages are sticky downward, they do not adjust toward what would have been
the new equilibrium wage (W1), at least not in the short run. Instead, after the shift in the labor demand curve,
the same quantity of workers is willing to work at that wage as before; however, the quantity of workers
demanded at that wage has declined from the original equilibrium (Q0) to Q2. The gap between the original
equilibrium quantity (Q0) and the new quantity demanded of labor (Q2) represents workers who would be
willing to work at the going wage but cannot find jobs. The gap represents the economic meaning of

unemployment.

FIGURE 8.7 Rising Wage and Low Unemployment: Where Is the Unemployment in Supply and Demand? (a) In a
labor market where wages are able to rise, an increase in the demand for labor from D0 to D1 leads to an increase in
equilibrium quantity of labor hired from Q0 to Q1 and a rise in the equilibrium wage from W0 to W1. (b) In a labor
market where wages do not decline, a fall in the demand for labor from D0 to D1 leads to a decline in the quantity of

206 8 • Unemployment

labor demanded at the original wage (W0) from Q0 to Q2. These workers will want to work at the prevailing wage
(W0), but will not be able to find jobs.

This analysis helps to explain the connection that we noted earlier: that unemployment tends to rise in

recessions and to decline during expansions. The overall state of the economy shifts the labor demand curve

and, combined with wages that are sticky downwards, unemployment changes. The rise in unemployment that

occurs because of a recession is cyclical unemployment.

8.4 What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Long Run

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain frictional and structural unemployment

• Assess relationships between the natural rate of employment and potential real GDP, productivity, and

public policy

•

Identify recent patterns in the natural rate of employment

• Propose ways to combat unemployment

Cyclical unemployment explains why unemployment rises during a recession and falls during an economic

expansion, but what explains the remaining level of unemployment even in good economic times? Why is the

unemployment rate never zero? Even when the U.S. economy is growing strongly, the unemployment rate only

rarely dips as low as 4%. Moreover, the discussion earlier in this chapter pointed out that unemployment rates

in many European countries like Italy, France, and Germany have often been remarkably high at various times

in the last few decades. Why does some level of unemployment persist even when economies are growing

strongly? Why are unemployment rates continually higher in certain economies, through good economic years

and bad? Economists have a term to describe the remaining level of unemployment that occurs even when the

economy is healthy: they call it the natural rate of unemployment.

The Long Run: The Natural Rate of Unemployment

The natural rate of unemployment is not “natural” in the sense that water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit or
boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit. It is not a physical and unchanging law of nature. Instead, it is only the

“natural” rate because it is the unemployment rate that would result from the combination of economic, social,

and political factors that exist at a time—assuming the economy was neither booming nor in recession. These

forces include the usual pattern of companies expanding and contracting their workforces in a dynamic

economy, social and economic forces that affect the labor market, or public policies that affect either the

eagerness of people to work or the willingness of businesses to hire. Let’s discuss these factors in more detail.

Frictional Unemployment

In a market economy, some companies are always going broke for a variety of reasons: old technology; poor

management; good management that happened to make bad decisions; shifts in tastes of consumers so that

less of the firm’s product is desired; a large customer who went broke; or tough domestic or foreign

competitors. Conversely, other companies will be doing very well for just the opposite reasons and looking to

hire more employees. In a perfect world, all of those who lost jobs would immediately find new ones. However,

in the real world, even if the number of job seekers is equal to the number of job vacancies, it takes time to find

out about new jobs, to interview and figure out if the new job is a good match, or perhaps to sell a house and

8.4 • What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Long Run 207

buy another in proximity to a new job. Economists call the unemployment that occurs in the meantime, as

workers move between jobs, frictional unemployment. Frictional unemployment is not inherently a bad

thing. It takes time on part of both the employer and the individual to match those looking for employment

with the correct job openings. For individuals and companies to be successful and productive, you want people

to find the job for which they are best suited, not just the first job offered.

In the mid-2000s, before the 2008–2009 recession, it was true that about 7% of U.S. workers saw their jobs

disappear in any three-month period. However, in periods of economic growth, these destroyed jobs are

counterbalanced for the economy as a whole by a larger number of jobs created. In 2019, for example, there

were typically about 6 million unemployed people at any given time in the U.S. economy. Even though about

two-thirds of those unemployed people found a job in 14 weeks or fewer, the unemployment rate did not

change much during the year, because those who found new jobs were largely offset by others who lost jobs.

Of course, it would be preferable if people who were losing jobs could immediately and easily move into newly

created jobs, but in the real world, that is not possible. Someone who is laid off by a textile mill in South

Carolina cannot turn around and immediately start working for a textile mill in California. Instead, the

adjustment process happens in ripples. Some people find new jobs near their old ones, while others find that
they must move to new locations. Some people can do a very similar job with a different company, while others
must start new career paths. Some people may be near retirement and decide to look only for part-time work,

while others want an employer that offers a long-term career path. The frictional unemployment that results

from people moving between jobs in a dynamic economy may account for one to two percentage points of total

unemployment.

The level of frictional unemployment will depend on how easy it is for workers to learn about alternative jobs,

which may reflect the ease of communications about job prospects in the economy. The extent of frictional

unemployment will also depend to some extent on how willing people are to move to new areas to find

jobs—which in turn may depend on history and culture.

Frictional unemployment and the natural rate of unemployment also seem to depend on the age distribution of

the population. Figure 8.4 (b) showed that unemployment rates are typically lower for people between 25–54

years of age or aged 55 and over than they are for those who are younger. “Prime-age workers,” as those in the

25–54 age bracket are sometimes called, are typically at a place in their lives when they want to have a job and

income arriving at all times. In addition, older workers who lose jobs may prefer to opt for retirement. By

contrast, it is likely that a relatively high proportion of those who are under 25 will be trying out jobs and life

options, and this leads to greater job mobility and hence higher frictional unemployment. Thus, a society with

a relatively high proportion of young workers, like the U.S. beginning in the mid-1960s when Baby Boomers

began entering the labor market, will tend to have a higher unemployment rate than a society with a higher

proportion of its workers in older ages.

Structural Unemployment

Another factor that influences the natural rate of unemployment is the amount of structural unemployment.

The structurally unemployed are individuals who have no jobs because they lack skills valued by the labor

market, either because demand has shifted away from the skills they do have, or because they never learned

any skills. An example of the former would be the unemployment among aerospace engineers after the U.S.

space program downsized in the 1970s. An example of the latter would be high school dropouts.

Some people worry that technology causes structural unemployment. In the past, new technologies have put

lower skilled employees out of work, but at the same time they create demand for higher skilled workers to use

the new technologies. Education seems to be the key in minimizing the amount of structural unemployment.

Individuals who have degrees can be retrained if they become structurally unemployed. For people with no

skills and little education, that option is more limited.

208 8 • Unemployment

Natural Unemployment and Potential Real GDP

The natural unemployment rate is related to two other important concepts: full employment and potential real

GDP. Economists consider the economy to be at full employment when the actual unemployment rate is equal

to the natural unemployment rate. When the economy is at full employment, real GDP is equal to potential real

GDP. By contrast, when the economy is below full employment, the unemployment rate is greater than the

natural unemployment rate and real GDP is less than potential. Finally, when the economy is above full

employment, then the unemployment rate is less than the natural unemployment rate and real GDP is greater

than potential. Operating above potential is only possible for a short while, since it is analogous to all workers

working overtime.

Productivity Shifts and the Natural Rate of Unemployment

Unexpected shifts in productivity can have a powerful effect on the natural rate of unemployment. Over time,

workers' productivity determines the level of wages in an economy. After all, if a business paid workers more

than could be justified by their productivity, the business will ultimately lose money and go bankrupt.

Conversely, if a business tries to pay workers less than their productivity then, in a competitive labor market,

other businesses will find it worthwhile to hire away those workers and pay them more.

However, adjustments of wages to productivity levels will not happen quickly or smoothly. Employers typically

review wages only once or twice a year. In many modern jobs, it is difficult to measure productivity at the

individual level. For example, how precisely would one measure the quantity produced by an accountant who

is one of many people working in the tax department of a large corporation? Because productivity is difficult to

observe, employers often determine wage increases based on recent experience with productivity. If

productivity has been rising at, say, 2% per year, then wages rise at that level as well. However, when

productivity changes unexpectedly, it can affect the natural rate of unemployment for a time.

The U.S. economy in the 1970s and 1990s provides two vivid examples of this process. In the 1970s,

productivity growth slowed down unexpectedly (as we discussed in Economic Growth). For example, output

per hour of U.S. workers in the business sector increased at an annual rate of 3.3% per year from 1960 to 1973,

but only 0.8% from 1973 to 1982. Figure 8.8 (a) illustrates the situation where the demand for labor—that is,

the quantity of labor that business is willing to hire at any given wage—has been shifting out a little each year
because of rising productivity, from D0 to D1 to D2. As a result, equilibrium wages have been rising each year
from W0 to W1 to W2. However, when productivity unexpectedly slows down, the pattern of wage increases
does not adjust right away. Wages keep rising each year from W2 to W3 to W4, but the demand for labor is no
longer shifting up. A gap opens where the quantity of labor supplied at wage level W4 is greater than the
quantity demanded. The natural rate of unemployment rises. In the aftermath of this unexpectedly low

productivity in the 1970s, the national unemployment rate did not fall below 7% from May, 1980 until 1986.
Over time, the rise in wages will adjust to match the slower gains in productivity, and the unemployment rate

will ease back down, but this process may take years.

8.4 • What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Long Run 209

FIGURE 8.8 Unexpected Productivity Changes and Unemployment (a) Productivity is rising, increasing the demand

for labor. Employers and workers become used to the pattern of wage increases. Then productivity suddenly stops

increasing. However, the expectations of employers and workers for wage increases do not shift immediately, so
wages keep rising as before. However, the demand for labor has not increased, so at wage W4, unemployment exists
where the quantity supplied of labor exceeds the quantity demanded. (b) The rate of productivity increase has been

zero for a time, so employers and workers have come to accept the equilibrium wage level (W). Then productivity
increases unexpectedly, shifting demand for labor from D0 to D1. At the wage (W), this means that the quantity
demanded of labor exceeds the quantity supplied, and with job offers plentiful, the unemployment rate will be low.

The late 1990s provide an opposite example: instead of the surprise decline in productivity that occurred in

the 1970s, productivity unexpectedly rose in the mid-1990s. The annual growth rate of real output per hour of

labor increased from 1.7% from 1980–1995, to an annual rate of 2.6% from 1995–2001. Let’s simplify the

situation a bit, so that the economic lesson of the story is easier to see graphically, and say that productivity

had not been increasing at all in earlier years, so the intersection of the labor market was at point E in Figure
8.8 (b), where the demand curve for labor (D0) intersects the supply curve for labor. As a result, real wages were
not increasing. Now, productivity jumps upward, which shifts the demand for labor out to the right, from D0 to
D1. At least for a time, however, wages are still set according to the earlier expectations of no productivity
growth, so wages do not rise. The result is that at the prevailing wage level (W), the quantity of labor demanded

(Qd) will for a time exceed the quantity of labor supplied (Qs), and unemployment will be very low—actually

below the natural level of unemployment for a time. This pattern of unexpectedly high productivity helps to

explain why the unemployment rate stayed below 4.5%—quite a low level by historical standards—from 1998

until after the U.S. economy had entered a recession in 2001.

Levels of unemployment will tend to be somewhat higher on average when productivity is unexpectedly low,

and conversely, will tend to be somewhat lower on average when productivity is unexpectedly high. However,

over time, wages do eventually adjust to reflect productivity levels.

Public Policy and the Natural Rate of Unemployment

Public policy can also have a powerful effect on the natural rate of unemployment. On the supply side of the

labor market, public policies to assist the unemployed can affect how eager people are to find work. For

example, if a worker who loses a job is guaranteed a generous package of unemployment insurance, welfare
benefits, food stamps, and government medical benefits, then the opportunity cost of unemployment is lower

and that worker will be less eager to seek a new job.

What seems to matter most is not just the amount of these benefits, but how long they last. A society that

provides generous help for the unemployed that cuts off after, say, six months, may provide less of an incentive

210 8 • Unemployment

for unemployment than a society that provides less generous help that lasts for several years. Conversely,

government assistance for job search or retraining can in some cases encourage people back to work sooner.

See the Clear it Up to learn how the U.S. handles unemployment insurance.

CLEAR IT UP

How does U.S. unemployment insurance work?
Unemployment insurance is a joint federal–state program that the federal government enacted in 1935. While the

federal government sets minimum standards for the program, state governments conduct most of the

administration.

The funding for the program is a federal tax collected from employers. The federal government requires tax

collection on the first $7,000 in wages paid to each worker; however, states can choose to collect the tax on a higher

amount if they wish, and 41 states have set a higher limit. States can choose the length of time that they pay

benefits, although most states limit unemployment benefits to 26 weeks—with extensions possible in times of

especially high unemployment. The states then use the fund to pay benefits to those who become unemployed.

Average unemployment benefits are equal to about one-third of the wage that the person earned in their previous

job, but the level of unemployment benefits varies considerably across states.

unemployment benefits to be classified as unemployed. While there are statistics kept and studied relating to how

8.4 • What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Long Run 211

On the demand side of the labor market, government rules, social institutions, and the presence of unions can

affect the willingness of firms to hire. For example, if a government makes it hard for businesses to start up or

to expand, by wrapping new businesses in bureaucratic red tape, then businesses will become more

discouraged about hiring. Government regulations can make it harder to start a business by requiring that a

new business obtain many permits and pay many fees, or by restricting the types and quality of products that a

company can sell. Other government regulations, like zoning laws, may limit where companies can conduct

business, or whether businesses are allowed to be open during evenings or on Sunday.

Whatever defenses may be offered for such laws in terms of social value—like the value some Christians place

on not working on Sunday, or Orthodox Jews or highly observant Muslims on Saturday—these kinds of

restrictions impose a barrier between some willing workers and other willing employers, and thus contribute

to a higher natural rate of unemployment. Similarly, if government makes it difficult to fire or lay off workers,

businesses may react by trying not to hire more workers than strictly necessary—since laying these workers off

would be costly and difficult. High minimum wages may discourage businesses from hiring low-skill workers.

Government rules may encourage and support powerful unions, which can then push up wages for union

workers, but at a cost of discouraging businesses from hiring those workers.

The Natural Rate of Unemployment in Recent Years

The underlying economic, social, and political factors that determine the natural rate of unemployment can

change over time, which means that the natural rate of unemployment can change over time, too.

Estimates by economists of the natural rate of unemployment in the U.S. economy in the early 2000s run at

about 4.5 to 5.5%. This is a lower estimate than earlier. We outline three of the common reasons that

economists propose for this change below.

1. The internet has provided a remarkable new tool through which job seekers can find out about jobs at

different companies and can make contact with relative ease. An internet search is far easier than trying

to find a list of local employers and then hunting up phone numbers for all of their human resources

departments, and requesting a list of jobs and application forms. Social networking sites such as LinkedIn

have changed how people find work as well.

2. The growth of the temporary worker industry has probably helped to reduce the natural rate of

unemployment. In the early 1980s, only about 0.5% of all workers held jobs through temp agencies. By the

early 2000s, the figure had risen above 2%. Temp agencies can provide jobs for workers while they are

looking for permanent work. They can also serve as a clearinghouse, helping workers find out about jobs

with certain employers and getting a tryout with the employer. For many workers, a temp job is a stepping-

stone to a permanent job that they might not have heard about or obtained any other way, so the growth of

temp jobs will also tend to reduce frictional unemployment.

3. The aging of the “baby boom generation”—the especially large generation of Americans born between

1946 and 1964—meant that the proportion of young workers in the economy was relatively high in the

1970s, as the boomers entered the labor market, but is relatively low today. As we noted earlier, middle-

aged and older workers are far more likely to experience low unemployment than younger workers, a

factor that tends to reduce the natural rate of unemployment as the baby boomers age.

The combined result of these factors is that the natural rate of unemployment was on average lower in the

1990s and the early 2000s than in the 1980s. The 2008–2009 Great Recession pushed monthly unemployment

rates up to 10% in late 2009. However, even at that time, the Congressional Budget Office was forecasting that

by 2015, unemployment rates would fall back to about 5%. During the first two months of 2020, the

unemployment rate held steady at 3.5%. As of the first quarter of 2022, the Congressional Budget Office

estimates the natural rate to be 4.6%.

The Natural Rate of Unemployment in Europe

By the standards of other high-income economies, the natural rate of unemployment in the U.S. economy

212 8 • Unemployment

appears relatively low. Through good economic years and bad, many European economies have had

unemployment rates hovering near 10%, or even higher, since the 1970s. European rates of unemployment

have been higher not because recessions in Europe have been deeper, but rather because the conditions

underlying supply and demand for labor have been different in Europe, in a way that has created a much

higher natural rate of unemployment.

Many European countries have a combination of generous welfare and unemployment benefits, together with

nests of rules that impose additional costs on businesses when they hire. In addition, many countries have

laws that require firms to give workers months of notice before laying them off and to provide substantial

severance or retraining packages after laying them off. The legally required notice before laying off a worker

can be more than three months in Spain, Germany, Denmark, and Belgium, and the legally required severance

package can be as high as a year’s salary or more in Austria, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece. Such laws will

surely discourage laying off or firing current workers. However, when companies know that it will be difficult to

fire or lay off workers, they also become hesitant about hiring in the first place.

We can attribute the typically higher levels of unemployment in many European countries in recent years,

which have prevailed even when economies are growing at a solid pace, to the fact that the sorts of laws and
regulations that lead to a high natural rate of unemployment are much more prevalent in Europe than in the
United States.

A Preview of Policies to Fight Unemployment

The Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy and Macroeconomic Policy Around the World chapters provide a

detailed discussion of how to fight unemployment, when we can discuss these policies in the context of the full

array of macroeconomic goals and frameworks for analysis. However, even at this preliminary stage, it is

useful to preview the main issues concerning policies to fight unemployment.

The remedy for unemployment will depend on the diagnosis. Cyclical unemployment is a short-term problem,

caused because the economy is in a recession. Thus, the preferred solution will be to avoid or minimize

recessions. As Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy discusses, governments can enact this policy by

stimulating the overall buying power in the economy, so that firms perceive that sales and profits are possible,

which makes them eager to hire.

Dealing with the natural rate of unemployment is trickier. In a market-oriented economy, firms will hire and

fire workers. Governments cannot control this. Furthermore, the evolving age structure of the economy's

population, or unexpected shifts in productivity are beyond a government's control and, will affect the natural

rate of unemployment for a time. However, as the example of high ongoing unemployment rates for many

European countries illustrates, government policy clearly can affect the natural rate of unemployment that will

persist even when GDP is growing.

When a government enacts policies that will affect workers or employers, it must examine how these policies

will affect the information and incentives employees and employers have to find one another. For example, the

government may have a role to play in helping some of the unemployed with job searches. Governments may

need to rethink the design of their programs that offer assistance to unemployed workers and protections to

employed workers so that they will not unduly discourage the supply of labor. Similarly, governments may

need to reassess rules that make it difficult for businesses to begin or to expand so that they will not unduly

discourage the demand for labor. The message is not that governments should repeal all laws affecting labor

markets, but only that when they enact such laws, a society that cares about unemployment will need to

consider the tradeoffs involved.

BRING IT HOME

Unemployment and the COVID-19 Pandemic
Almost two years after the pandemic began, the unemployment rate was on track to go below 4% again by early- to

mid-2022. While this is great news for workers, we have also seen that the story of the labor market is more

complicated than a single statistic might suggest. Millions remained out of the labor force due to the public health

situation, and the percentage of workers unemployed for longer than 26 weeks was still high.

The shift to remote work helped the unemployment rate come down by providing greater flexibility for workers

concerned with their health and safety. But it didn't help workers, especially women, who continued to be burdened

with excessive care responsibilities at home. During 2020, the unemployment rate for women exceeded that of men

by over a full percentage point. Additionally, virus variants in other countries threatened to disrupt progress made at

home and abroad.

The pandemic has helped shed light on how we can use information from all areas of the labor market to evaluate

the health of the economy.

Key Concepts and Summary

8.1 How Economists Define and Compute Unemployment Rate

Unemployment imposes high costs. Unemployed individuals experience loss of income and stress. An

economy with high unemployment suffers an opportunity cost of unused resources. We can divide the adult

population into those in the labor force and those out of the labor force. In turn, we divide those in the labor

force into employed and unemployed. A person without a job must be willing and able to work and actively

looking for work to be counted as unemployed; otherwise, a person without a job is counted as out of the labor

force. Economists define the unemployment rate as the number of unemployed persons divided by the

number of persons in the labor force (not the overall adult population). The Current Population Survey (CPS)

conducted by the United States Census Bureau measures the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed.

The establishment payroll survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics measures the net change in jobs created for

the month.

8.2 Patterns of Unemployment

The U.S. unemployment rate rises during periods of recession and depression, but falls back to the range of 4%

to 6% when the economy is strong. The unemployment rate never falls to zero. Despite enormous growth in the

size of the U.S. population and labor force in the twentieth century, along with other major trends like

globalization and new technology, the unemployment rate shows no long-term rising trend.

Unemployment rates differ by group: higher for African-Americans and Hispanic people than for White

people; higher for less educated than more educated; higher for the young than the middle-aged. Women’s

unemployment rates used to be higher than men’s, but in recent years men’s and women’s unemployment

8 • Self-Check Questions 215

rates have been very similar. In recent years, unemployment rates in the United States have compared

favorably with unemployment rates in most other high-income economies.

8.3 What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Short Run

Cyclical unemployment rises and falls with the business cycle. In a labor market with flexible wages, wages will

adjust in such a market so that quantity demanded of labor always equals the quantity supplied of labor at the

equilibrium wage. Economists have proposed many theories for why wages might not be flexible, but instead

may adjust only in a “sticky” way, especially when it comes to downward adjustments: implicit contracts,

efficiency wage theory, adverse selection of wage cuts, insider-outsider model, and relative wage coordination.

8.4 What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Long Run

The natural rate of unemployment is the rate of unemployment that the economic, social, and political forces

in the economy would cause even when the economy is not in a recession. These factors include the frictional

unemployment that occurs when people either choose to change jobs or are put out of work for a time by the

shifts of a dynamic and changing economy. They also include any laws concerning conditions of hiring and

firing that have the undesired side effect of discouraging job formation. They also include structural

unemployment, which occurs when demand shifts permanently away from a certain type of job skill.

Critical Thinking Questions

30. Using the definition of the unemployment rate, is an increase in the unemployment rate necessarily a bad

thing for a nation?

31. Is a decrease in the unemployment rate necessarily a good thing for a nation? Explain.

32. If many workers become discouraged from looking for jobs, explain how the number of jobs could decline

could be some other reasons for the higher unemployment rate?

35. While unemployment is highly negatively correlated with the level of economic activity, in the real world it

pick up. What do you think accounts for the lag in response time?

explained in this section apply to your argument?

38. Under what condition would a decrease in unemployment be bad for the economy?

39. Under what condition would an increase in the unemployment rate be a positive sign?

40. As the baby boom generation retires, the ratio of retirees to workers will increase noticeably. How will this

affect the Social Security program? How will this affect the standard of living of the average American?

41. Unemployment rates have been higher in many European countries in recent decades than in the United

States. Is the main reason for this long-term difference in unemployment rates more likely to be cyclical

unemployment or the natural rate of unemployment? Explain briefly.

42. Is it desirable to pursue a goal of zero unemployment? Why or why not?

43. Is it desirable to eliminate natural unemployment? Why or why not? Hint: Think about what our economy

would look like today and what assumptions would have to be met to have a zero rate of natural

unemployment.

44. The U.S. unemployment rate increased from 4.6% in July 2001 to 5.9% by June 2002. Without studying

the subject in any detail, would you expect that a change of this kind is more likely to be due to cyclical

unemployment or a change in the natural rate of unemployment? Why?

Introduction to Inflation

BRING IT HOME

A $550 Million Loaf of Bread?
If you were born within the last three decades in the United States, Canada, or many other countries in the

developed world, you probably have no real experience with a high rate of inflation. Inflation is when most prices in

an entire economy are rising. However, there is an extreme form of inflation called hyperinflation. This occurred in

Germany between 1921 and 1928, and more recently in Zimbabwe between 2008 and 2009. In November 2008,

Zimbabwe had an inflation rate of 79.6 billion percent. In contrast, in 2014, the United States had an average annual

rate of inflation of 1.6%.

220 9 • Inflation

Zimbabwe’s inflation rate was so high it is difficult to comprehend, so let’s put it into context. It is equivalent to price

increases of 98% per day. This means that, from one day to the next, prices essentially double. What is life like in an

economy afflicted with hyperinflation? Most of you reading this will have never experienced this phenomenon. The

government adjusted prices for commodities in Zimbabwean dollars several times each day. There was no desire to

hold on to currency since it lost value by the minute. The people there spent a great deal of time getting rid of any

cash they acquired by purchasing whatever food or other commodities they could find. At one point, a loaf of bread

cost 550 million Zimbabwean dollars. Teachers' salaries were in the trillions a month; however, this was equivalent

to only one U.S. dollar a day. At its height, it took 621,984,228 Zimbabwean dollars to purchase one U.S. dollar.

Government agencies had no money to pay their workers so they started printing money to pay their bills rather than

raising taxes. Rising prices caused the government to enact price controls on private businesses, which led to

shortages and the emergence of black markets. In 2009, the country abandoned its currency and allowed people to

use foreign currencies for purchases.

How does this happen? How can both government and the economy fail to function at the most basic level? Before

we consider these extreme cases of hyperinflation, let’s first look at inflation itself.

Inflation is a general and ongoing rise in the level of prices in an entire economy. Inflation does not refer to a

change in relative prices. A relative price change occurs when you see that the price of tuition has risen, but

the price of laptops has fallen. Inflation, on the other hand, means that there is pressure for prices to rise in

most markets in the economy. In addition, price increases in the supply-and-demand model were one-time

events, representing a shift from a previous equilibrium to a new one. Inflation implies an ongoing rise in

prices. If inflation happened for one year and then stopped, then it would not be inflation any more.

This chapter begins by showing how to combine prices of individual goods and services to create a measure of

overall inflation. It discusses the historical and recent experience of inflation, both in the United States and in

other countries around the world. Other chapters have sometimes included a note under an exhibit or a

parenthetical reminder in the text saying that the numbers have been adjusted for inflation. In this chapter, it

is time to show how to use inflation statistics to adjust other economic variables, so that you can tell how much

of, for example, we can attribute the rise in GDP over different periods of time to an actual increase in the

production of goods and services and how much we should attribute to the fact that prices for most items have

risen.

Inflation has consequences for people and firms throughout the economy, in their roles as lenders and

borrowers, wage-earners, taxpayers, and consumers. The chapter concludes with a discussion of some

imperfections and biases in the inflation statistics, and a preview of policies for fighting inflation that we will

discuss in other chapters.

9.1 Tracking Inflation

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Calculate the annual rate of inflation

• Explain and use index numbers and base years when simplifying the total quantity spent over a year for

products

• Calculate inflation rates using index numbers

Dinner table conversations where you might have heard about inflation usually entail reminiscing about when

“everything seemed to cost so much less. You used to be able to buy three gallons of gasoline for a dollar and

then go see an afternoon movie for another dollar.” Table 9.1 compares some prices of common goods in 1970

and 2017. Of course, the average prices in this table may not reflect the prices where you live. The cost of living

in New York City is much higher than in Houston, Texas, for example. In addition, certain products have

evolved over recent decades. A new car in 2021, loaded with antipollution equipment, safety gear,

computerized engine controls, and many other technological advances, is a more advanced machine (and

more fuel efficient) than your typical 1970s car. However, put details like these to one side for the moment, and

look at the overall pattern. The primary reason behind the price rises in Table 9.1—and all the price increases

for the other products in the economy—is not specific to the market for housing or cars or gasoline or movie

tickets. Instead, it is part of a general rise in the level of all prices. At the beginning of 2021, $1 had about the

same purchasing power in overall terms of goods and services as 15 cents did in 1972, because of the amount

of inflation that has occurred over that time period.

References at end of book.)

Moreover, the power of inflation does not affect just goods and services, but wages and income levels, too. The

second-to-last row of Table 9.1 shows that the average hourly wage for a manufacturing worker increased

nearly ten-fold from 1970 to 2021. The average worker in 2021 is better educated and more productive than

the average worker in 1970—but not six times more productive. Per capita GDP increased substantially from

1970 to 2021, but is the average person in the U.S. economy really more than twelve times better off in just 51

years? Not likely.

A modern economy has millions of goods and services whose prices are continually quivering in the breezes of

supply and demand. How can all of these shifts in price attribute to a single inflation rate? As with many

problems in economic measurement, the conceptual answer is reasonably straightforward: Economists

combine prices of a variety of goods and services into a single price level. The inflation rate is simply the

percentage change in the price level. Applying the concept, however, involves some practical difficulties.

The Price of a Basket of Goods

To calculate the price level, economists begin with the concept of a basket of goods and services, consisting of

the different items individuals, businesses, or organizations typically buy. The next step is to look at how the

prices of those items change over time. In thinking about how to combine individual prices into an overall

price level, many people find that their first impulse is to calculate the average of the prices. Such a calculation,

however, could easily be misleading because some products matter more than others.

Changes in the prices of goods for which people spend a larger share of their incomes will matter more than

changes in the prices of goods for which people spend a smaller share of their incomes. For example, an

increase of 10% in the rental rate on housing matters more to most people than whether the price of carrots

rises by 10%. To construct an overall measure of the price level, economists compute a weighted average of the

222 9 • Inflation

prices of the items in the basket, where the weights are based on the actual quantities of goods and services

people buy. The following Work It Out feature walks you through the steps of calculating the annual rate of

inflation based on a few products.

WORK IT OUT

Calculating an Annual Rate of Inflation
Consider the simple basket of goods with only three items, represented in Table 9.2. Say that in any given month,

a college student spends money on 20 hamburgers, one bottle of aspirin, and five movies. The table provides

prices for these items over four years through each time period (Pd). Prices of some goods in the basket may rise

while others fall. In this example, the price of aspirin does not change over the four years, while movies increase

in price and hamburgers bounce up and down. The table shows the cost of buying the given basket of goods at

the prices prevailing at that time.

TABLE 9.2 A College Student’s Basket of Goods

To calculate the annual rate of inflation in this example:

Step 1. Find the percentage change in the cost of purchasing the overall basket of goods between the time
periods. The general equation for percentage changes between two years, whether in the context of inflation or

in any other calculation, is:

Step 2. From period 1 to period 2, the total cost of purchasing the basket of goods in Table 9.2 rises from $100 to

$106.50. Therefore, the percentage change over this time—the inflation rate—is:

Step 3. From period 2 to period 3, the overall change in the cost of purchasing the basket rises from $106.50 to

$107. Thus, the inflation rate over this time, again calculated by the percentage change, is approximately:

Step 4. From period 3 to period 4, the overall cost rises from $107 to $117.50. The inflation rate is thus:

This calculation of the change in the total cost of purchasing a basket of goods accounts for how much a student

spends on each good. Hamburgers are the lowest-priced good in this example, and aspirin is the highest-priced.

If an individual buys a greater quantity of a low-price good, then it makes sense that changes in the price of that

good should have a larger impact on the buying power of that person’s money. The larger impact of hamburgers

shows up in the “amount spent” row, where, in all time periods, hamburgers are the largest item within the

amount spent row.

Index Numbers

The numerical results of a calculation based on a basket of goods can get a little messy. The simplified example

in Table 9.2 has only three goods and the prices are in even dollars, not numbers like 79 cents or $124.99. If

the list of products were much longer, and we used more realistic prices, the total quantity spent over a year
might be some messy-looking number like $17,147.51 or $27,654.92.

To simplify the task of interpreting the price levels for more realistic and complex baskets of goods,

economists typically report the price level in each period as an index number, rather than as the dollar

amount for buying the basket of goods. Economists create price indices to calculate an overall average change

in relative prices over time. To convert the money spent on the basket to an index number, economists

arbitrarily choose one year to be the base year, or starting point from which we measure changes in prices.

The base year, by definition, has an index number equal to 100. This sounds complicated, but it is really a

simple math trick. In the example above, say that we choose time period 3 as the base year. Since the total

amount of spending in that year is $107, we divide that amount by itself ($107) and multiply by 100. Again, this

is because the index number in the base year alwayshas to have a value of 100. Then, to figure out the values

of the index number for the other years, we divide the dollar amounts for the other years by 1.07 as well. Note

also that the dollar signs cancel out so that index numbers have no units.

Table 9.3 shows calculations for the other values of the index number, based on the example in Table 9.2.

Because we calculate the index numbers so that they are in exactly the same proportion as the total dollar cost

of purchasing the basket of goods, we can calculate the inflation rate based on the index numbers, using the

percentage change formula. Thus, the inflation rate from period 1 to period 2 would be

This is the same answer that we derived when measuring inflation based on the dollar cost of the basket of

goods for the same time period.

224 9 • Inflation

If the inflation rate is the same whether it is based on dollar values or index numbers, then why bother with the

index numbers? The advantage is that indexing allows easier eyeballing of the inflation numbers. If you glance

at two index numbers like 107 and 110, you know automatically that the rate of inflation between the two years

is about, but not quite exactly equal to, 3%. By contrast, imagine that we express the price levels in absolute

dollars of a large basket of goods, so that when you looked at the data, the numbers were $19,493.62 and

$20,040.17. Most people find it difficult to eyeball those kinds of numbers and say that it is a change of about

3%. However, the two numbers expressed in absolute dollars are exactly in the same proportion of 107 to 110

as the previous example. If you’re wondering why simple subtraction of the index numbers wouldn’t work,

read the following Clear It Up feature.

CLEAR IT UP

Why do you not just subtract index numbers?
A word of warning: When a price index moves from, say, 107 to 110, the rate of inflation is not exactly3%.

Remember, the inflation rate is not derived by subtracting the index numbers, but rather through the percentage-

change calculation. We calculate the precise inflation rate as the price index moves from 107 to 110 as 100 x (110 –
107) / 107 = 100 x 0.028 = 2.8%. When the base year is fairly close to 100, a quick subtraction is not a terrible
shortcut to calculating the inflation rate—but when precision matters down to tenths of a percent, subtracting will

not give the right answer.

Two final points about index numbers are worth remembering. First, index numbers have no dollar signs or

other units attached to them. Although we can use index numbers to calculate a percentage inflation rate, the

index numbers themselves do not have percentage signs. Index numbers just mirror the proportions that we

find in other data. They transform the other data so that it is easier to work with the data.

Second, the choice of a base year for the index number—that is, the year that is automatically set equal to

100—is arbitrary. We choose it as a starting point from which we can track changes in prices. In the official

inflation statistics, it is common to use one base year for a few years, and then to update it, so that the base

year of 100 is relatively close to the present. However, any base year that we choose for the index numbers will

result in exactly the same inflation rate. To see this in the previous example, imagine that period 1 is the base

year when total spending was $100, and we assign it an index number of 100. At a glance, you can see that the

index numbers would now exactly match the dollar figures, and the inflation rate in the first period would be

6.5%.

Now that we see how indexes work to track inflation, the next module will show us how economists measure

the cost of living.

9.2 • How to Measure Changes in the Cost of Living 225

Government statisticians at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics calculate the CPI based on the prices in a fixed

basket of goods and services that represents the purchases of the average family of four. In recent years, the

statisticians have paid considerable attention to a subtle problem: that the change in the total cost of buying a

fixed basket of goods and services over time is conceptually not quite the same as the change in the cost of

living, because the cost of living represents how much it costs for a person to feel that their consumption

provides an equal level of satisfaction or utility.

To understand the distinction, imagine that over the past 10 years, the cost of purchasing a fixed basket of

goods increased by 25% and your salary also increased by 25%. Has your personal standard of living held

constant? If you do not necessarily purchase an identical fixed basket of goods every year, then an inflation

calculation based on the cost of a fixed basket of goods may be a misleading measure of how your cost of living

has changed. Two problems arise here: substitution bias and quality/new goods bias.

When the price of a good rises, consumers tend to purchase less of it and to seek out substitutes instead.

Conversely, as the price of a good falls, people will tend to purchase more of it. This pattern implies that goods

with generally rising prices should tend over time to become less important in the overall basket of goods used

to calculate inflation, while goods with falling prices should tend to become more important. Consider, as an
example, a rise in the price of peaches by $100 per pound. If consumers were utterly inflexible in their
demand for peaches, this would lead to a big rise in the price of food for consumers. Alternatively, imagine that

people are utterly indifferent to whether they have peaches or other types of fruit. Now, if peach prices rise,

people completely switch to other fruit choices and the average price of food does not change at all. A fixed and

unchanging basket of goods assumes that consumers are locked into buying exactly the same goods,

regardless of price changes—not a very likely assumption. Thus, substitution bias—the rise in the price of a

fixed basket of goods over time—tends to overstate the rise in a consumer’s true cost of living, because it does

not take into account that the person can substitute away from goods whose relative prices have risen.

The other major problem in using a fixed basket of goods as the basis for calculating inflation is how to deal

with the arrival of improved versions of older goods or altogether new goods. Consider the problem that arises

if a cereal is improved by adding 12 essential vitamins and minerals—and also if a box of the cereal costs 5%

more. It would clearly be misleading to count the entire resulting higher price as inflation, because the new

price reflects a higher quality (or at least different) product. Ideally, one would like to know how much of the

higher price is due to the quality change, and how much of it is just a higher price. The Bureau of Labor

Statistics, which is responsible for computing the Consumer Price Index, must deal with these difficulties in

adjusting for quality changes.

Consider how these prices compare to today’s models. Is the product today of a different quality?

We can think of a new product as an extreme improvement in quality—from something that did not exist to

something that does. However, the basket of goods that was fixed in the past obviously does not include new

goods created since then. The basket of goods and services in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is revised and

updated over time, and so new products are gradually included. However, the process takes some time. For

example, room air conditioners were widely sold in the early 1950s, but were not introduced into the basket of

goods behind the Consumer Price Index until 1964. The VCR and personal computer were available in the late

1970s and widely sold by the early 1980s, but did not enter the CPI basket of goods until 1987. By 1996, there

were more than 40 million cellular phone subscribers in the United States—but cell phones were not yet part of

the CPI basket of goods. The parade of inventions has continued, with the CPI inevitably lagging a few years

behind.

The arrival of new goods creates problems with respect to the accuracy of measuring inflation. The reason

226 9 • Inflation

people buy new goods, presumably, is that the new goods offer better value for money than existing goods.

Thus, if the price index leaves out new goods, it overlooks one of the ways in which the cost of living is

improving. In addition, the price of a new good is often higher when it is first introduced and then declines

over time. If the new good is not included in the CPI for some years, until its price is already lower, the CPI may

miss counting this price decline altogether. Taking these arguments together, the quality/new goods bias

means that the rise in the price of a fixed basket of goods over time tends to overstate the rise in a consumer’s

true cost of living, because it does not account for how improvements in the quality of existing goods or the

invention of new goods improves the standard of living. The following Clear It Up feature is a must-read on

how statisticians comprise and calculate the CPI.

CLEAR IT UP

How do U.S. government statisticians measure the Consumer Price Index?
When the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calculates the Consumer Price Index, the first task is to decide on a

basket of goods that is representative of the purchases of the average household. We do this by using the Consumer

Expenditure Survey, a national survey of about 7,000 households, which provides detailed information on spending
habits. Statisticians divide consumer expenditures into eight major groups (seen below), which in turn they divide
into more than 200 individual item categories. The BLS currently uses 1982–1984 as the base period.

For each of the 200 individual expenditure items, the BLS chooses several hundred very specific examples of that

item and looks at the prices of those examples. In figuring out the “breakfast cereal” item under the overall category

of “foods and beverages,” the BLS picks several hundred examples of breakfast cereal. One example might be the

price of a 24-oz. box of a particular brand of cereal sold at a particular store. The BLS statistically selects specific

products and sizes and stores to reflect what people buy and where they shop. The basket of goods in the Consumer

Price Index thus consists of about 80,000 products; that is, several hundred specific products in over 200 broad-

item categories. Statisticians rotate about one-quarter of these 80,000 specific products of the sample each year,

and replace them with a different set of products.

The next step is to collect data on prices. Data collectors visit or call about 23,000 stores in 87 urban areas all over

the United States every month to collect prices on these 80,000 specific products. The BLS also conducts a survey

of 50,000 landlords or tenants to collect information about rents.

Statisticians then calculate the Consumer Price Index by taking the 80,000 prices of individual products and

combining them, using weights (see Figure 9.2) determined by the quantities of these products that people buy and

allowing for factors like substitution between goods and quality improvements, into price indices for the 200 or so

overall items. Then, the statisticians combine the price indices for the 200 items into an overall Consumer Price

Index. According the Consumer Price Index website, there are eight categories that data collectors use:

The Eight Major Categories in the Consumer Price Index

1. Food and beverages (breakfast cereal, milk, coffee, chicken, wine, full-service meals, and snacks)

2. Housing (renter’s cost of housing, homeowner’s cost of housing, fuel oil, bedroom furniture)

3. Apparel (men’s shirts and sweaters, women’s dresses, jewelry)

4. Transportation (new vehicles, airline fares, gasoline, motor vehicle insurance)

5. Medical care (prescription drugs and medical supplies, physicians’ services, eyeglasses and eye care, hospital

services)

6. Recreation (televisions, cable television, pets and pet products, sports equipment, admissions)

7. Education and communication (college tuition, postage, telephone services, computer software and

accessories)

8. Other goods and services (tobacco and smoking products, haircuts and other personal services, funeral

expenses)

FIGURE 9.2 The Weighting of CPI Components Of the eight categories used to generate the Consumer Price Index,

housing is the highest at 42.4%. The next highest category, food and beverage at 15.1%, is less than half the size of

housing. Other goods and services, and apparel, are the lowest at 3.2% and 2.7%, respectively. (Source:

The CPI and Core Inflation Index

Imagine if you were driving a company truck across the country- you probably would care about things like the

prices of available roadside food and motel rooms as well as the truck’s operating condition. However, the

manager of the firm might have different priorities. He would care mostly about the truck’s on-time

performance and much less so about the food you were eating and the places you were staying. In other words,

the company manager would be paying attention to the firm's production, while ignoring transitory elements

that impacted you, but did not affect the company’s bottom line.

In a sense, a similar situation occurs with regard to measures of inflation. As we’ve learned, CPI measures

prices as they affect everyday household spending. Economists typically calculate a core inflation index by

taking the CPI and excluding volatile economic variables. In this way, economists have a better sense of the

underlying trends in prices that affect the cost of living.

Examples of excluded variables include energy and food prices, which can jump around from month to month

because of the weather. According to an article by Kent Bernhard, during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, a key

supply point for the nation’s gasoline was nearly knocked out. Gas prices quickly shot up across the nation, in

some places by up to 40 cents a gallon in one day. This was not the cause of an economic policy but rather a

short-lived event until the pumps were restored in the region. In this case, the CPI that month would register

the change as a cost of living event to households, but the core inflation index would remain unchanged. As a

result, the Federal Reserve’s decisions on interest rates would not be influenced. Similarly, droughts can cause

world-wide spikes in food prices that, if temporary, do not affect the nation’s economic capability.

As former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke noted in 1999 about the core inflation index, “It

provide(s) a better guide to monetary policy than the other indices, since it measures the more persistent

underlying inflation rather than transitory influences on the price level.” Bernanke also noted that it helps

communicate that the Federal Reserve does not need to respond to every inflationary shock since some price

changes are transitory and not part of a structural change in the economy.

In sum, both the CPI and the core inflation index are important, but serve different audiences. The CPI helps

households understand their overall cost of living from month to month, while the core inflation index is a

preferred gauge from which to make important government policy changes.

228 9 • Inflation

Practical Solutions for the Substitution and the Quality/New Goods Biases

By the early 2000s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics was using alternative mathematical methods for calculating

the Consumer Price Index, more complicated than just adding up the cost of a fixed basket of goods, to allow

for some substitution between goods. It was also updating the basket of goods behind the CPI more frequently,

so that it could include new and improved goods more rapidly. For certain products, the BLS was carrying out

studies to try to measure the quality improvement. For example, with computers, an economic study can try to

adjust for changes in speed, memory, screen size, and other product characteristics, and then calculate the

change in price after accounting for these product changes. However, these adjustments are inevitably

imperfect, and exactly how to make these adjustments is often a source of controversy among professional

economists.

By the early 2000s, the substitution bias and quality/new goods bias had been somewhat reduced, so that since

then the rise in the CPI probably overstates the true rise in inflation by only about 0.5% per year. Over one or a

few years, this is not much. Over a period of a decade or two, even half of a percent per year compounds to a

more significant amount. In addition, the CPI tracks prices from physical locations, and not at online sites like

Amazon, where prices can be lower.

When measuring inflation (and other economic statistics, too), a tradeoff arises between simplicity and

interpretation. If we calculate the inflation rate with a basket of goods that is fixed and unchanging, then the

calculation of an inflation rate is straightforward, but the problems of substitution bias and quality/new goods

bias will arise. However, when the basket of goods is allowed to shift and evolve to reflect substitution toward

lower relative prices, quality improvements, and new goods, the technical details of calculating the inflation

rate grow more complex.

Additional Price Indices: PPI, GDP Deflator, and More

The basket of goods behind the Consumer Price Index represents an average hypothetical U.S. household's

consumption, which is to say that it does not exactly capture anyone’s personal experience. When the task is to

calculate an average level of inflation, this approach works fine. What if, however, you are concerned about

inflation experienced by a certain group, like the elderly, or the poor, or single-parent families with children, or

Hispanic-Americans? In specific situations, a price index based on the buying power of the average consumer

may not feel quite right.

This problem has a straightforward solution. If the Consumer Price Index does not serve the desired purpose,

then invent another index, based on a basket of goods appropriate for the group of interest. The Bureau of

Labor Statistics publishes a number of experimental price indices: some for particular groups like the elderly

or the poor, some for different geographic areas, and some for certain broad categories of goods like food or

housing.

The BLS also calculates several price indices that are not based on baskets of consumer goods. For example,

the Producer Price Index (PPI) is based on prices paid for supplies and inputs by producers of goods and

services. We can break it down into price indices for different industries, commodities, and stages of

processing (like finished goods, intermediate goods, or crude materials for further processing). There is an

International Price Index based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported. An Employment

Cost Index measures wage inflation in the labor market. The GDP deflator, which the Bureau of Economic

Analysis measures, is a price index that includes all the GDP components (that is, consumption plus

investment plus government plus exports minus imports). Unlike the CPI, its baskets are not fixed but re-

calculate what that year’s GDP would have been worth using the base-year’s prices. MIT's Billion Prices Project

is a more recent alternative attempt to measure prices: economists collect data online from retailers and then

put them into an index that they compare to the CPI (Source: http://bpp.mit.edu/usa/).

What’s the best measure of inflation? If one is concerned with the most accurate measure of inflation, one

should use the GDP deflator as it picks up the prices of goods and services produced. However, it is not a good

9.3 • How the U.S. and Other Countries Experience Inflation 229

measure of the cost of living as it includes prices of many products not purchased by households (for example,

aircraft, fire engines, factory buildings, office complexes, and bulldozers). If one wants the most accurate

measure of inflation as it impacts households, one should use the CPI, as it only picks up prices of products

purchased by households. That is why economists sometimes refer to the CPI as the cost-of-living index. As the

Bureau of Labor Statistics states on its website: “The ‘best’ measure of inflation for a given application depends

on the intended use of the data.”

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

•

Identify patterns of inflation for the United States using data from the Consumer Price Index

Identify patterns of inflation on an international level

In the last three decades, inflation has been relatively low in the U.S. economy, with the Consumer Price Index

typically rising 2% to 4% per year. Looking back over the twentieth century, there have been several periods

where inflation caused the price level to rise at double-digit rates, but nothing has come close to

hyperinflation.

Historical Inflation in the U.S. Economy

Figure 9.3 (a) shows the level of prices in the Consumer Price Index stretching back to 1913. In this case, the

base years (when the CPI is defined as 100) are set for the average level of prices that existed from 1982 to

1984. Figure 9.3 (b) shows the annual percentage changes in the CPI over time, which is the inflation rate.

FIGURE 9.3 U.S. Price Level and Inflation Rates since 1947 Graph a shows the trends in the U.S. price level from the

year 1947 to 2020. In 1947, the graph starts out close to 22. It gradually increases until about 1973, then increases

more rapidly through the remainder of the 1970s and beyond, with periodic dips, until 2020, when it reached

around 260. Graph b shows the trends in U.S. inflation rates from the year 1948 to 2020. In 1948, the graph starts

out with inflation at almost 7%, goes up and down periodically, with peaks in the 1940s and the 1970s, until settling

to around 1.2% in 2020.

230 9 • Inflation

Inflation as measured by the consumer price index reflects the annual percentage change in the cost to the

average consumer of acquiring a basket of goods and services that may be fixed or changed at specified

intervals, such as yearly.

The first two waves of inflation are easy to characterize in historical terms: they are right after World War I and

World War II. However, there are also two periods of severe negative inflation—called deflation—in the early

decades of the twentieth century: one following the deep 1920-21 recession and the other during the Great

Depression of the 1930s. (Since inflation is a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and

services is reduced, deflation will be a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services

increases.) For the period from 1900 to about 1960, the major inflations and deflations nearly balanced each

other out, so the average annual rate of inflation over these years was only about 1% per year. A third wave of

more severe inflation arrived in the 1970s and departed in the early 1980s.

Times of recession or depression often seem to be times when the inflation rate is lower, as in the recession of

1920–1921, the Great Depression, the recession of 1980–1982, and the Great Recession in 2008–2009. There

were a few months in 2009 that were deflationary, but not at an annual rate. High levels of unemployment

typically accompany recessions, and the total demand for goods falls, pulling the price level down. Conversely,

the rate of inflation often, but not always, seems to start moving up when the economy is growing very strongly,

like right after wartime or during the 1960s. The frameworks for macroeconomic analysis, that we developed

in other chapters, will explain why recession often accompanies higher unemployment and lower inflation,

while rapid economic growth often brings lower unemployment but higher inflation.

Inflation around the World

Around the rest of the world, the pattern of inflation has been very mixed; Figure 9.4 shows inflation rates over

the last several decades. Many industrialized countries, not just the United States, had relatively high inflation

rates in the 1970s. For example, in 1975, Japan’s inflation rate was over 8% and the inflation rate for the

United Kingdom was almost 25%. In the 1980s, inflation rates came down in the United States and in Europe

and have largely stayed down.

FIGURE 9.4 Countries with Relatively Low Inflation Rates, 1961–2020 This chart shows the annual percentage

change in consumer prices compared with the previous year’s consumer prices in the United States, the United

Kingdom, Japan, and Germany.

Countries with controlled economies in the 1970s, like the Soviet Union and China, historically had very low

rates of measured inflation—because prices were forbidden to rise by law, except for the cases where the

government deemed a price increase to be due to quality improvements. However, these countries also had

perpetual shortages of goods, since forbidding prices to rise acts like a price ceiling and creates a situation

where quantity demanded often exceeds quantity supplied. As Russia and China made a transition toward

more market-oriented economies, they also experienced outbursts of inflation, although we should regard the

statistics for these economies as somewhat shakier. Inflation in China averaged about 10% per year for much

of the 1980s and early 1990s, although it has dropped off since then. Russia experienced hyperinflation—an

outburst of high inflation—of 2,500% per year in the early 1990s, although by 2006 Russia’s consumer price

inflation had dipped below 10% per year, as Figure 9.5 shows. The closest the United States has ever reached

hyperinflation was during the 1860–1865 Civil War, in the Confederate states.

9.4 • The Confusion Over Inflation 233

Many countries in Latin America experienced raging inflation during the 1980s and early 1990s, with inflation

rates often well above 100% per year. In 1990, for example, both Brazil and Argentina saw inflation climb

above 2000%. Certain countries in Africa experienced extremely high rates of inflation, sometimes bordering

on hyperinflation, in the 1990s. Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, had an inflation rate of 75% in

1995.

In the early 2000s, the problem of inflation appears to have diminished for most countries, at least in

comparison to the worst times of recent decades. As we noted in this earlier Bring it Home feature, in recent

years, the world’s worst example of hyperinflation was in Zimbabwe, where at one point the government was

issuing bills with a face value of $100 trillion (in Zimbabwean dollars)—that is, the bills had

$100,000,000,000,000 written on the front, but were almost worthless. In many countries, the memory of

double-digit, triple-digit, and even quadruple-digit inflation is not very far in the past.

9.4 The Confusion Over Inflation

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain how inflation can cause redistributions of purchasing power

•

Identify ways inflation can blur the perception of supply and demand

• Explain the economic benefits and challenges of inflation

Economists usually oppose high inflation, but they oppose it in a milder way than many non-economists.

Robert Shiller, one of 2013’s Nobel Prize winners in economics, carried out several surveys during the 1990s

about attitudes toward inflation. One of his questions asked, “Do you agree that preventing high inflation is an

important national priority, as important as preventing drug use or preventing deterioration in the quality of

our schools?” Answers were on a scale of 1–5, where 1 meant “Fully agree” and 5 meant “Completely

disagree.” For the U.S. population as a whole, 52% answered “Fully agree” that preventing high inflation was a

highly important national priority and just 4% said “Completely disagree.” However, among professional

economists, only 18% answered “Fully agree,” while the same percentage of 18% answered “Completely

disagree.”

The Land of Funny Money

What are the economic problems caused by inflation, and why do economists often regard them with less

concern than the general public? Consider a very short story: “The Land of Funny Money.”

One morning, everyone in the Land of Funny Money awakened to find that everything denominated in money

had increased by 20%. The change was completely unexpected. Every price in every store was 20% higher.

Paychecks were 20% higher. Interest rates were 20 % higher. The amount of money, everywhere from wallets
to savings accounts, was 20% larger. This overnight inflation of prices made newspaper headlines everywhere

in the Land of Funny Money. However, the headlines quickly disappeared, as people realized that in terms of

what they could actually buy with their incomes, this inflation had no economic impact. Everyone’s pay could

still buy exactly the same set of goods as it did before. Everyone’s savings were still sufficient to buy exactly the

same car, vacation, or retirement that they could have bought before. Equal levels of inflation in all wages and

prices ended up not mattering much at all.

When the people in Robert Shiller’s surveys explained their concern about inflation, one typical reason was

that they feared that as prices rose, they would not be able to afford to buy as much. In other words, people

were worried because they did not live in a place like the Land of Funny Money, where all prices and wages

rose simultaneously. Instead, people live here on Planet Earth, where prices might rise while wages do not rise

at all, or where wages rise more slowly than prices.

Economists note that over most periods, the inflation level in prices is roughly similar to the inflation level in

wages, and so they reason that, on average, over time, people’s economic status is not greatly changed by

234 9 • Inflation

inflation. If all prices, wages, and interest rates adjusted automatically and immediately with inflation, as in the

Land of Funny Money, then no one’s purchasing power, profits, or real loan payments would change. However,

if other economic variables do not move exactly in sync with inflation, or if they adjust for inflation only after a

time lag, then inflation can cause three types of problems: unintended redistributions of purchasing power,

blurred price signals, and difficulties in long-term planning.

Unintended Redistributions of Purchasing Power

Inflation can cause redistributions of purchasing power that hurt some and help others. People who are hurt

by inflation include those who are holding considerable cash, whether it is in a safe deposit box or in a

cardboard box under the bed. When inflation happens, the buying power of cash diminishes. However, cash is

only an example of a more general problem: anyone who has financial assets invested in a way that the

nominal return does not keep up with inflation will tend to be affected by inflation. For example, if a person

has money in a bank account that pays 4% interest, but inflation rises to 5%, then the real rate of return for the

money invested in that bank account is negative 1%.

The problem of a good-looking nominal interest rate transforming into an ugly-looking real interest rate can

be worsened by taxes. The U.S. income tax is charged on the nominal interest received in dollar terms, without

an adjustment for inflation. Thus, the government taxes a person who invests $10,000 and receives a 5%

nominal rate of interest on the $500 received—no matter whether the inflation rate is 0%, 5%, or 10%. If

inflation is 0%, then the real interest rate is 5% and all $500 is a gain in buying power. However, if inflation is

5%, then the real interest rate is zero and the person had no real gain—but owes income tax on the nominal

gain anyway. If inflation is 10%, then the real interest rate is negative5% and the person is actually falling

behind in buying power, but would still owe taxes on the $500 in nominal gains.

Inflation can cause unintended redistributions for wage earners, too. Wages do typically creep up with inflation

over time, eventually. The last row of Table 9.1 at the start of this chapter showed that the average hourly wage

in manufacturing in the U.S. economy increased from $3.23 in 1970 to $30.11 in 2021, which is an increase by

a factor of close to ten. Over that time period, the Consumer Price Index increased by about a factor of eight.

However, increases in wages may lag behind inflation for a year or two, since wage adjustments are often

somewhat sticky and occur only once or twice a year. Moreover, the extent to which wages keep up with

inflation creates insecurity for workers and may involve painful, prolonged conflicts between employers and

employees. If the government adjusts minimum wage for inflation only infrequently, minimum wage workers

are losing purchasing power from their nominal wages, as Figure 9.6 shows.

9.4 • The Confusion Over Inflation 235

FIGURE 9.6 U.S. Minimum Wage and Inflation After adjusting for inflation, the federal minimum wage dropped

about 30 percent from 1965–2020, even though the nominal figure climbed from $1.40 to $7.25 per hour.

Increases in the minimum wage in between 2008 and 2010 kept the decline from being worse—as it would have

been if the wage had remained the same as it did from 1997 through 2007. Since 2010, the real minimum wage has

continued to decline. (Sources: http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/chart.htm and http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/

surveymost?cu)

One sizable group of people has often received a large share of their income in a form that does not increase

over time: retirees who receive a private company pension. Most pensions have traditionally been set as a fixed

nominal dollar amount per year at retirement. For this reason, economists call pensions “defined benefits”

plans. Even if inflation is low, the combination of inflation and a fixed income can create a substantial problem

over time. A person who retires on a fixed income at age 65 will find that losing just 1% to 2% of buying power

per year to inflation compounds to a considerable loss of buying power after a decade or two.

Fortunately, pensions and other defined benefits retirement plans are increasingly rare, replaced instead by

“defined contribution” plans, such as 401(k)s and 403(b)s. In these plans, the employer contributes a fixed

amount to the worker’s retirement account on a regular basis (usually every pay check). The employee often

contributes as well. The worker invests these funds in a wide range of investment vehicles. These plans are tax

deferred, and they are portable so that if the individual takes a job with a different employer, their 401(k)

comes with them. To the extent that the investments made generate real rates of return, retirees are not

burdened by the inflation costs of traditional pensioners.

However, ordinary people can sometimes benefit from the unintended redistributions of inflation. Consider

someone who borrows $10,000 to buy a car at a fixed interest rate of 9%. If inflation is 3% at the time the loan

is made, then the borrower must repay the loan at a real interest rate of 6%. However, if inflation rises to 9%,

then the real interest rate on the loan is zero. In this case, the borrower’s benefit from inflation is the lender’s

loss. A borrower paying a fixed interest rate, who benefits from inflation, is just the flip side of an investor

receiving a fixed interest rate, who suffers from inflation. The lesson is that when interest rates are fixed, rises

in the rate of inflation tend to penalize suppliers of financial capital, who receive repayment in dollars that are

236 9 • Inflation

worth less because of inflation, while demanders of financial capital end up better off, because they can repay

their loans in dollars that are worth less than originally expected.

The unintended redistributions of buying power that inflation causes may have a broader effect on society.

America’s widespread acceptance of market forces rests on a perception that people’s actions have a

reasonable connection to market outcomes. When inflation causes a retiree who built up a pension or invested

at a fixed interest rate to suffer, however, while someone who borrowed at a fixed interest rate benefits from

inflation, it is hard to believe that this outcome was deserved in any way. Similarly, when homeowners benefit

from inflation because the price of their homes rises, while renters suffer because they are paying higher rent,

it is hard to see any useful incentive effects. One of the reasons that the general public dislikes inflation is a

sense that it makes economic rewards and penalties more arbitrary—and therefore likely to be perceived as

unfair – even dangerous, as the next Clear It Up feature shows.

CLEAR IT UP

Is there a connection between German hyperinflation and Hitler’s rise to power?
Germany suffered an intense hyperinflation of its currency, the Mark, in the years after World War I, when the

Weimar Republic in Germany resorted to printing money to pay its bills and the onset of the Great Depression

created the social turmoil that Adolf Hitler was able to take advantage of in his rise to power. Shiller described the

connection this way in a National Bureau of Economic Research 1996 Working Paper:

A fact that is probably little known to young people today, even in Germany, is that the final collapse of the

Mark in 1923, the time when the Mark’s inflation reached astronomical levels (inflation of 35,974.9% in
November 1923 alone, for an annual rate that month of 4.69 × 1028%), came in the same month as did
Hitler’s Beer Hall Putsch, his Nazi Party’s armed attempt to overthrow the German government. This failed

putsch resulted in Hitler’s imprisonment, at which time he wrote his book Mein Kampf, setting forth an

inspirational plan for Germany’s future, suggesting plans for world domination. . .

. . . Most people in Germany today probably do not clearly remember these events; this lack of attention to

it may be because its memory is blurred by the more dramatic events that succeeded it (the Nazi seizure of

power and World War II). However, to someone living through these historical events in sequence . . . [the

putsch] may have been remembered as vivid evidence of the potential effects of inflation.

Blurred Price Signals

Prices are the messengers in a market economy, conveying information about conditions of demand and

supply. Inflation blurs those price messages. Inflation means that we perceive price signals more vaguely, like
a radio program received with considerable static. If the static becomes severe, it is hard to tell what is

happening.

In Israel, when inflation accelerated to an annual rate of 500% in 1985, some stores stopped posting prices

directly on items, since they would have had to put new labels on the items or shelves every few days to reflect

inflation. Instead, a shopper just took items from a shelf and went up to the checkout register to find out the

price for that day. Obviously, this situation makes comparing prices and shopping for the best deal rather

difficult. When the levels and changes of prices become uncertain, businesses and individuals find it harder to

react to economic signals. In a world where inflation is at a high rate, but bouncing up and down to some

extent, does a higher price of a good mean that inflation has risen, or that supply of that good has decreased, or

that demand for that good has increased? Should a buyer of the good take the higher prices as an economic

hint to start substituting other products—or have the prices of the substitutes risen by an equal amount?

Should a seller of the good take a higher price as a reason to increase production—or is the higher price only a

sign of a general inflation in which the prices of all inputs to production are rising as well? The true story will

presumably become clear over time, but at a given moment, who can say?

9.4 • The Confusion Over Inflation 237

High and variable inflation means that the incentives in the economy to adjust in response to changes in prices

are weaker. Markets will adjust toward their equilibrium prices and quantities more erratically and slowly, and

many individual markets will experience a greater chance of surpluses and shortages.

Problems of Long-Term Planning

Inflation can make long-term planning difficult. In discussing unintended redistributions, we considered the

case of someone trying to plan for retirement with a pension that is fixed in nominal terms and a high rate of

inflation. Similar problems arise for all people trying to save for retirement, because they must consider what

their money will really buy several decades in the future when we cannot know the rate of future inflation.

Inflation, especially at moderate or high levels, will pose substantial planning problems for businesses, too. A

firm can make money from inflation—for example, by paying bills and wages as late as possible so that it can

pay in inflated dollars, while collecting revenues as soon as possible. A firm can also suffer losses from

inflation, as in the case of a retail business that gets stuck holding too much cash, only to see inflation eroding

the value of that cash. However, when a business spends its time focusing on how to profit by inflation, or at

least how to avoid suffering from it, an inevitable tradeoff strikes: less time is spent on improving products and

services or on figuring out how to make existing products and services more cheaply. An economy with high

inflation rewards businesses that have found clever ways of profiting from inflation, which are not necessarily

the businesses that excel at productivity, innovation, or quality of service.

In the short term, low or moderate levels of inflation may not pose an overwhelming difficulty for business

planning, because costs of doing business and sales revenues may rise at similar rates. If, however, inflation

varies substantially over the short or medium term, then it may make sense for businesses to stick to shorter-

term strategies. The evidence as to whether relatively low rates of inflation reduce productivity is controversial

among economists. There is some evidence that if inflation can be held to moderate levels of less than 3% per

year, it need not prevent a nation’s real economy from growing at a healthy pace. For some countries that have

experienced hyperinflation of several thousand percent per year, an annual inflation rate of 20–30% may feel

basically the same as zero. However, several economists have pointed to the suggestive fact that when U.S.

inflation heated up in the early 1970s—to 10%—U.S. growth in productivity slowed down, and when inflation

slowed down in the 1980s, productivity edged up again not long thereafter, as Figure 9.7 shows.

FIGURE 9.7 U.S. Inflation Rate and U.S. Labor Productivity, 1961–2020 Over the last several decades in the United

States, there have been times when rising inflation rates have been closely followed by lower productivity rates and

lower inflation rates have corresponded to increasing productivity rates. As the graph shows, however, this

correlation does not always exist.

238 9 • Inflation

Any Benefits of Inflation?

Although the economic effects of inflation are primarily negative, two countervailing points are worth noting.

First, the impact of inflation will differ considerably according to whether it is creeping up slowly at 0% to 2%

per year, galloping along at 10% to 20% per year, or racing to the point of hyperinflation at, say, 40% per

month. Hyperinflation can rip an economy and a society apart. An annual inflation rate of 2%, 3%, or 4%,

however, is a long way from a national crisis. Low inflation is also better than deflation which occurs with

severe recessions.

Second, economists sometimes argue that moderate inflation may help the economy by making wages in labor

markets more flexible. The discussion in Unemployment pointed out that wages tend to be sticky in their

downward movements and that unemployment can result. A little inflation could nibble away at real wages,

and thus help real wages to decline if necessary. In this way, even if a moderate or high rate of inflation may act

as sand in the gears of the economy, perhaps a low rate of inflation serves as oil for the gears of the labor

market. This argument is controversial. A full analysis would have to account for all the effects of inflation. It

does, however, offer another reason to believe that, all things considered, very low rates of inflation may not be

especially harmful.

9.5 Indexing and Its Limitations

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain the relationship between indexing and inflation

•

Identify three ways the government can control inflation through macroeconomic policy

When a price, wage, or interest rate is adjusted automatically with inflation, economists use the term indexed.

An indexed payment increases according to the index number that measures inflation. Those in private

markets and government programs observe a wide range of indexing arrangements. Since the negative effects

of inflation depend in large part on having inflation unexpectedly affect one part of the economy but not

another—say, increasing the prices that people pay but not the wages that workers receive—indexing will take

some of the sting out of inflation.

Indexing in Private Markets

In the 1970s and 1980s, labor unions commonly negotiated wage contracts that had cost-of-living

adjustments (COLAs) which guaranteed that their wages would keep up with inflation. These contracts were

sometimes written as, for example, COLA plus 3%. Thus, if inflation was 5%, the wage increase would

automatically be 8%, but if inflation rose to 9%, the wage increase would automatically be 12%. COLAs are a

form of indexing applied to wages.

Loans often have built-in inflation adjustments, too, so that if the inflation rate rises by two percentage points,

then the interest rate that a financial institution charges on the loan rises by two percentage points as well. An

adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is a type of loan that one can use to purchase a home in which the interest

rate varies with the rate of inflation. Often, a borrower will be able to receive a lower interest rate if borrowing

with an ARM, compared to a fixed-rate loan. The reason is that with an ARM, the lender is protected against the

risk that higher inflation will reduce the real loan payments, and so the risk premium part of the interest rate

can be correspondingly lower.

A number of ongoing or long-term business contracts also have provisions that prices will adjust automatically

according to inflation. Sellers like such contracts because they are not locked into a low nominal selling price if

inflation turns out higher than expected. Buyers like such contracts because they are not locked into a high

buying price if inflation turns out to be lower than expected. A contract with automatic adjustments for

inflation in effect agrees on a real price for the borrower to pay, rather than a nominal price.

9.5 • Indexing and Its Limitations 239

Indexing in Government Programs

Many government programs are indexed to inflation. The U.S. income tax code is designed so that as a person’s

income rises above certain levels, the tax rate on the marginal income earned rises as well. That is what the

expression “move into a higher tax bracket” means. For example, according to the basic tax tables from the

Internal Revenue Service, in 2020, a married person filing jointly owed 10% of all taxable income from $0 to

$19,750; 12% of all income from $19,751 to $80,250; 22% of all taxable income from $80,251 to $171,050;

24% of all taxable income from $171,051 to $326,600; 32% of all taxable income from $326,601 to $414,700;

35% of all taxable income from $414,701 to $622,050; and 37% of all income from $622,051 and above.

Because of the many complex provisions in the rest of the tax code, it is difficult to determine exactly the taxes

an individual owes the government based on these numbers, but the numbers illustrate the basic theme that

tax rates rise as the marginal dollar of income rises. Until the late 1970s, if nominal wages increased along

with inflation, people were moved into higher tax brackets and owed a higher proportion of their income in

taxes, even though their real income had not risen. In 1981, the government eliminated this “bracket creep”.

Now, the income levels where higher tax rates kick in are indexed to rise automatically with inflation.

The Social Security program offers two examples of indexing. Since the passage of the Social Security Indexing

Act of 1972, the level of Social Security benefits increases each year along with the Consumer Price Index. Also,

Social Security is funded by payroll taxes, which the government imposes on the income earned up to a certain

amount—$137,700 in 2020. The government adjusts this level of income upward each year according to the

rate of inflation, so that an indexed increase in the Social Security tax base accompanies the indexed rise in the

benefit level.

As yet another example of a government program affected by indexing, in 1996 the U.S., government began

offering indexed bonds. Bonds are means by which the U.S. government (and many private-sector companies

as well) borrows money; that is, investors buy the bonds, and then the government repays the money with

interest. Traditionally, government bonds have paid a fixed rate of interest. This policy gave a government that

had borrowed an incentive to encourage inflation, because it could then repay its past borrowing in inflated

dollars at a lower real interest rate. However, indexed bonds promise to pay a certain real rate of interest above

whatever inflation rate occurs. In the case of a retiree trying to plan for the long term and worried about the

risk of inflation, for example, indexed bonds that guarantee a rate of return higher than inflation—no matter

the level of inflation—can be a very comforting investment.

Might Indexing Reduce Concern over Inflation?

Indexing may seem like an obviously useful step. After all, when individuals, firms, and government programs

are indexed against inflation, then people can worry less about arbitrary redistributions and other effects of

inflation.

However, some of the fiercest opponents of inflation express grave concern about indexing. They point out that

indexing is always partial. Not every employer will provide COLAs for workers. Not all companies can assume

that costs and revenues will rise in lockstep with the general rates of inflation. Not all interest rates for

borrowers and savers will change to match inflation exactly. However, as partial inflation indexing spreads, the

political opposition to inflation may diminish. After all, older people whose Social Security benefits are

protected against inflation, or banks that have loaned their money with adjustable-rate loans, no longer have

as much reason to care whether inflation heats up. In a world where some people are indexed against inflation

and some are not, financially savvy businesses and investors may seek out ways to be protected against

inflation, while the financially unsophisticated and small businesses may feel it the most.

A Preview of Policy Discussions of Inflation

This chapter has focused on how economists measure inflation, historical experience with inflation, how to

adjust nominal variables into real ones, how inflation affects the economy, and how indexing works. We have

240 9 • Inflation

barely hinted at the causes of inflation, and we have not addressed government policies to deal with inflation.

We will examine these issues in depth in other chapters. However, it is useful to offer a preview here.

We can sum up the cause of inflation in one phrase: Too many dollars chasing too few goods. The great surges

of inflation early in the twentieth century came after wars, which are a time when government spending is very

high, but consumers have little to buy, because production is going to the war effort. Governments also

commonly impose price controls during wartime. After the war, the price controls end and pent-up buying

power surges forth, driving up inflation. Otherwise, if too few dollars are chasing too many goods, then

inflation will decline or even turn into deflation. Therefore, we typically associate slowdowns in economic

activity, as in major recessions and the Great Depression, with a reduction in inflation or even outright

deflation.

The policy implications are clear. If we are to avoid inflation, the amount of purchasing power in the economy

must grow at roughly the same rate as the production of goods. Macroeconomic policies that the government

can use to affect the amount of purchasing power—through taxes, spending, and regulation of interest rates

and credit—can thus cause inflation to rise or reduce inflation to lower levels.

BRING IT HOME

Inflation in a Pandemic—A Return to the 1970s, or a Temporary Adjustment?
The pandemic-induced recession caused all sorts of disruptions to our economy, including inflation. During the

pandemic, the prices for goods like gas and cars fell as people shifted to remote work and canceled travel plans. But

as the economy started to recover from the pandemic in early 2021, we started to see large increases in these

prices. Higher prices were also fueled by the injections of cash into the economy through stimulus checks and

unemployment benefits. The pandemic also caused shortages throughout the global supply chain, further pushing

prices up (you'll learn more about this idea in a few chapters when we talk about aggregate supply and demand).

With headline annualized inflation rates in 2021 exceeding 6%, the question in the next few years is whether we'll

see permanently high inflation rates of 9%, 10%, or more, like we did in the 1970s and early-1980s. Some

economists believe the pandemic-induced inflation is just a transitory adjustment—indeed, used car and gasoline

prices rose dramatically in 2010 and 2011 as well, as we were recovering from the Great Recession. Others are

more concerned that the inflation is permanent. Shortages continue to exist throughout the economy as of early

2022, and if consumers expect higher inflation, it can be a self-fulfilling prophecy, as they start buying things now in

order to avoid future bouts of inflation.

As you learned about earlier, inflation is a major concern of consumers, if less of an issue among economists. But

inflation should be matched by increases in living standards, otherwise there could be major implications for the

economy.

Key Concepts and Summary

9.1 Tracking Inflation

Economists measure the price level by using a basket of goods and services and calculating how the total cost

of buying that basket of goods will increase over time. Economists often express the price level in terms of

index numbers, which transform the cost of buying the basket of goods and services into a series of numbers

in the same proportion to each other, but with an arbitrary base year of 100. We measure the inflation rate as

the percentage change between price levels or index numbers over time.

9.2 How to Measure Changes in the Cost of Living

Measuring price levels with a fixed basket of goods will always have two problems: the substitution bias, by

which a fixed basket of goods does not allow for buying more of what becomes relatively less expensive and

less of what becomes relatively more expensive; and the quality/new goods bias, by which a fixed basket

cannot account for improvements in quality and the advent of new goods. These problems can be reduced in

242 9 • Self-Check Questions

degree—for example, by allowing the basket of goods to evolve over time—but we cannot totally eliminate them.

The most commonly cited measure of inflation is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is based on a basket of

goods representing what the typical consumer buys. The Core Inflation Index further breaks down the CPI by

excluding volatile economic commodities. Several price indices are not based on baskets of consumer goods.

The GDP deflator is based on all GDP components. The Producer Price Index is based on prices of supplies and

inputs bought by producers of goods and services. An Employment Cost Index measures wage inflation in the

labor market. An International Price Index is based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported.

9.3 How the U.S. and Other Countries Experience Inflation

In the U.S. economy, the annual inflation rate in the last two decades has typically been around 2% to 4%. The

periods of highest inflation in the United States in the twentieth century occurred during the years after World

Wars I and II, and in the 1970s. The period of lowest inflation—actually, with deflation—was the 1930s Great

Depression.

9.4 The Confusion Over Inflation

Unexpected inflation will tend to hurt those whose money received, in terms of wages and interest payments,

does not rise with inflation. In contrast, inflation can help those who owe money that they can pay in less
valuable, inflated dollars. Low rates of inflation have relatively little economic impact over the short term. Over

the medium and the long term, even low rates of inflation can complicate future planning. High rates of

inflation can muddle price signals in the short term and prevent market forces from operating efficiently, and

can vastly complicate long-term savings and investment decisions.

9.5 Indexing and Its Limitations

A payment is indexed if it is automatically adjusted for inflation. Examples of indexing in the private sector

include wage contracts with cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) and loan agreements like adjustable-rate

mortgages (ARMs). Examples of indexing in the public sector include tax brackets and Social Security

payments.

mortgage. If inflation falls unexpectedly by 3%, what would likely happen to a homeowner with an

adjustable-rate mortgage?

21. Name several forms of indexing in the private and public sector.

Critical Thinking Questions

22. Inflation rates, like most statistics, are imperfect measures. Can you identify some ways that the inflation

rate for fruit does not perfectly capture the rising price of fruit?

23. Given the federal budget deficit in recent years, some economists have argued that by adjusting Social

Security payments for inflation using the CPI, Social Security is overpaying recipients. What is their

argument, and do you agree or disagree with it?

24. Why is the GDP deflator not an accurate measure of inflation as it impacts a household?

25. Imagine that the government statisticians who calculate the inflation rate have been updating the basic

basket of goods once every 10 years, but now they decide to update it every five years. How will this

change affect the amount of substitution bias and quality/new goods bias?

26. Describe a situation, either a government policy situation, an economic problem, or a private sector

situation, where using the CPI to convert from nominal to real would be more appropriate than using the

GDP deflator.

27. Describe a situation, either a government policy situation, an economic problem, or a private sector

situation, where using the GDP deflator to convert from nominal to real would be more appropriate than

using the CPI.

28. Why do you think the U.S. experience with inflation over the last 50 years has been so much milder than in

many other countries?

29. If, over time, wages and salaries on average rise at least as fast as inflation, why do people worry about

how inflation affects incomes?

30. Who in an economy is the big winner from inflation?

31. If a government gains from unexpected inflation when it borrows, why would it choose to offer indexed

bonds?

32. Do you think perfect indexing is possible? Why or why not?

Problems

33. The index number representing the price level changes from 110 to 115 in one year, and then from 115 to

120 the next year. Since the index number increases by five each year, is five the inflation rate each year?

Is the inflation rate the same each year? Explain your answer.

34. The total price of purchasing a basket of goods in the United Kingdom over four years is: year 1=£940,

year 2=£970, year 3=£1000, and year 4=£1070. Calculate two price indices, one using year 1 as the base

year (set equal to 100) and the other using year 4 as the base year (set equal to 100). Then, calculate the

inflation rate based on the first price index. If you had used the other price index, would you get a different

inflation rate? If you are unsure, do the calculation and find out.

Introduction to the International Trade and Capital Flows

BRING IT HOME

More than Meets the Eye in the Congo
How much do you interact with the global financial system? Do you think not much? Think again. Suppose you take

248 10 • The International Trade and Capital Flows

out a student loan, or you deposit money into your bank account. You just affected domestic savings and borrowing.

Now say you are at the mall and buy two T-shirts “made in China,” and later contribute to a charity that helps

refugees. What is the impact? You affected how much money flows into and out of the United States. If you open an

IRA savings account and put money in an international mutual fund, you are involved in the flow of money overseas.

While your involvement may not seem as influential as that of someone like the president, who can increase or

decrease foreign aid and, thereby, have a huge impact on money flows in and out of the country, you do interact with

the global financial system on a daily basis.

The balance of payments—a term you will meet soon—seems like a huge topic, but once you learn the specific

components of trade and money, it all makes sense. Along the way, you may have to give up some common

misunderstandings about trade and answer some questions: If a country is running a trade deficit, is that bad? Is a

trade surplus good? For example, look at the Democratic Republic of the Congo (often referred to as “Congo”), a

large country in Central Africa. In 2013, it ran a trade surplus of $1 billion, so it must be doing well, right? In

contrast, the trade deficit in the United States was $508 billion in 2013. Do these figures suggest that the United

States economy is performing worse than the Congolese economy? Not necessarily. The U.S. trade deficit tends to

worsen as the economy strengthens. In contrast, high poverty rates in the Congo persist, and these rates are not

going down even with the positive trade balance. Clearly, it is more complicated than simply asserting that running a

trade deficit is bad for the economy. You will learn more about these issues and others in this chapter.

The balance of trade (or trade balance) is any gap between a nation’s dollar value of its exports, or what its

producers sell abroad, and a nation’s dollar value of imports, or the foreign-made products and services that

households and businesses purchase. Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that if exports exceed

imports, the economy has a trade surplus. If imports exceed exports, the economy has a trade deficit. If exports

and imports are equal, then trade is balanced, but what happens when trade is out of balance and large trade

surpluses or deficits exist?

Germany, for example, has had substantial trade surpluses in recent decades, in which exports have greatly

exceeded imports. According to the World Bank, in 2020, Germany ran a trade surplus of $242 billion. In

contrast, the U.S. economy in recent decades has experienced large trade deficits, in which imports have

considerably exceeded exports. In 2020, for example, U.S. imports exceeded exports by $651 billion.

A series of financial crises triggered by unbalanced trade can lead economies into deep recessions. These

crises begin with large trade deficits. At some point, foreign investors become pessimistic about the economy

and move their money to other countries. The economy then drops into deep recession, with real GDP often

falling up to 10% or more in a single year. This happened to Mexico in 1995 when their GDP fell 8.1%. A

number of countries in East Asia—Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia—succumbed to the same

economic illness in 1997–1998 (called the Asian Financial Crisis). In the late 1990s and into the early 2000s,

Russia and Argentina had the identical experience. What are the connections between imbalances of trade in

goods and services and the flows of international financial capital that set off these economic avalanches?

We will start by examining the balance of trade in more detail, by looking at some patterns of trade balances in

the United States and around the world. Then we will examine the intimate connection between international

flows of goods and services and international flows of financial capital, which to economists are really just two

sides of the same coin. People often assume that trade surpluses like those in Germany must be a positive sign

for an economy, while trade deficits like those in the United States must be harmful. As it turns out, both trade

surpluses and deficits can be either good or bad. We will see why in this chapter.

10.1 Measuring Trade Balances

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain merchandise trade balance, current account balance, and unilateral transfers

•

Identify components of the U.S. current account balance

• Calculate the merchandise trade balance and current account balance using import and export data for a

country

A few decades ago, it was common to track the solid or physical items that planes, trains, and trucks

transported between countries as a way of measuring the balance of trade. Economists call this measurement

the merchandise trade balance. In most high-income economies, including the United States, goods comprise

less than half of a country’s total production, while services comprise more than half. The last two decades

have seen a surge in international trade in services, powered by technological advances in

telecommunications and computers that have made it possible to export or import customer services, finance,

law, advertising, management consulting, software, construction engineering, and product design. Most global

trade still takes the form of goods rather than services, and the government announces and the media
prominently report the merchandise trade balance. Old habits are hard to break. Economists, however,
typically rely on broader measures such as the balance of trade or the current account balance which

includes other international flows of income and foreign aid.

Components of the U.S. Current Account Balance

Table 10.1 breaks down the four main components of the U.S. current account balance for the last quarter of

2015 (seasonally adjusted). The first line shows the merchandise trade balance; that is, exports and imports of

goods. Because imports exceed exports, the trade balance in the final column is negative, showing a

merchandise trade deficit. We can explain how the government collects this trade information in the following

CLEAR IT UP

How does the U.S. government collect trade statistics?
Do not confuse the balance of trade (which tracks imports and exports), with the current account balance, which

includes not just exports and imports, but also income from investment and transfers.

250 10 • The International Trade and Capital Flows

The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) within the U.S. Department of Commerce compiles statistics on the balance

of trade using a variety of different sources. Merchandise importers and exporters must file monthly documents with

the Census Bureau, which provides the basic data for tracking trade. To measure international trade in

services—which can happen over a telephone line or computer network without shipping any physical goods—the

BEA carries out a set of surveys. Another set of BEA surveys tracks investment flows, and there are even specific

surveys to collect travel information from U.S. residents visiting Canada and Mexico. For measuring unilateral

transfers, the BEA has access to official U.S. government spending on aid, and then also carries out a survey of

charitable organizations that make foreign donations.

The BEA then cross-checks this information on international flows of goods and capital against other available data.

For example, the Census Bureau also collects data from the shipping industry, which it can use to check the data on

trade in goods. All companies involved in international flows of capital—including banks and companies making

financial investments like stocks—must file reports, which the U.S. Department of the Treasury ultimately checks.

The BEA also can cross check information on foreign trade by looking at data collected by other countries on their

foreign trade with the United States, and also at the data collected by various international organizations. Take these

data sources, stir carefully, and you have the U.S. balance of trade statistics. Much of the statistics that we cite in

this chapter come from these sources.

The second row of Table 10.1 provides data on trade in services. Here, the U.S. economy is running a surplus.

Although the level of trade in services is still relatively small compared to trade in goods, the importance of

services has expanded substantially over the last few decades. For example, U.S. exports of services were equal

to about one-half of U.S. exports of goods in 2020, compared to one-fifth in 1980.

The third component of the current account balance, labeled “income payments,” refers to money that U.S.

financial investors received on their foreign investments (money flowing into the United States) and payments

to foreign investors who had invested their funds here (money flowing out of the United States). The reason for

including this money on foreign investment in the overall measure of trade, along with goods and services, is

that, from an economic perspective, income is just as much an economic transaction as car, wheat, or oil

shipments: it is just trade that is happening in the financial capital market.

The final category of the current account balance is unilateral transfers, which are payments that

government, private charities, or individuals make in which they send money abroad without receiving any

direct good or service. Economic or military assistance from the U.S. government to other countries fits into

this category, as does spending abroad by charities to address poverty or social inequalities. When an

individual in the United States sends money overseas, as is the case with some immigrants, it is also counted

in this category. The current account balance treats these unilateral payments like imports, because they also

involve a stream of payments leaving the country. For the U.S. economy, unilateral transfers are almost always

negative. This pattern, however, does not always hold. In 1991, for example, when the United States led an

international coalition against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq in the Gulf War, many other nations agreed that they

would make payments to the United States to offset the U.S. war expenses. These payments were large enough

that, in 1991, the overall U.S. balance on unilateral transfers was a positive $10 billion.

The following Work It Out feature steps you through the process of using the values for goods, services, and

income payments to calculate the merchandise balance and the current account balance.

TABLE 10.2 Calculating Merchandise Balance and Current Account Balance

Use the information given below to fill in Table 10.2, and then calculate:

Known information:

• Unilateral transfers: $130

• Exports in goods: $1,046

• Exports in services: $509

•

•

•

Imports in goods: $1,562

Imports in services: $371

Income received by U.S. investors on foreign stocks and bonds: $561

Income received by foreign investors on U.S. assets: $472

Step 1. Focus on goods and services first. Enter the dollar amount of exports of both goods and services under

the Export column.

Step 2. Enter imports of goods and services under the Import column.

Step 3. Under the Export column and in the row for Income payments, enter the financial flows of money coming

back to the United States. U.S. investors are earning this income from abroad.

Step 4. Under the Import column and in the row for Income payments, enter the financial flows of money going

out of the United States to foreign investors. Foreign investors are earning this money on U.S. assets, like stocks.

Step 5. Unilateral transfers are money flowing out of the United States in the form of, for example, military aid,

foreign aid, and global charities. Because the money leaves the country, enter it under Imports and in the final

column as well, as a negative.

Step 6. Calculate the trade balance by subtracting imports from exports in both goods and services. Enter this in

the final Balance column. This can be positive or negative.

Step 7. Subtract the income payments flowing out of the country (under Imports) from the money coming back to

the United States (under Exports) and enter this amount under the Balance column.

Step 8. Enter unilateral transfers as a negative amount under the Balance column.

Step 9. The merchandise trade balance is the difference between exports of goods and imports of goods—the

252 10 • The International Trade and Capital Flows

first number under Balance.

Step 10. Now sum up your columns for Exports, Imports, and Balance. The final balance number is the current

account balance.

The merchandise balance of trade is the difference between exports and imports. In this case, it is equal to

$1,046 – $1,562, a trade deficit of –$516 billion. The current account balance is –$419 billion. See the

10.2 Trade Balances in Historical and International Context

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Analyze graphs of the current account balance and the merchandise trade balance

•

Identify patterns in U.S. trade surpluses and deficits

• Compare the U.S. trade surpluses and deficits to other countries' trade surpluses and deficits

We present the history of the U.S. current account balance in recent decades in several different ways. Figure

10.2 (a) shows the current account balance and the merchandise trade balance—the latter of which is simply

the balance on goods exported versus imported—in dollar terms. Figure 10.2 (b) shows the current account

balance and merchandise account balance yet again, this time as a share of the GDP for that year. By dividing

the trade deficit in each year by GDP in that year, Figure 10.2 (b) factors out both inflation and growth in the

real economy.

and a deficit in its current account balance. (b) This shows the same items—trade balance and current account

By either measure, the U.S. balance of trade pattern is clear. From the 1960s into the 1970s, the U.S. economy

had mostly small trade surpluses—that is, the graphs in Figure 10.2 show positive numbers. However, starting

in the 1980s, the trade deficit increased rapidly, and after a tiny surplus in 1991, the current account trade

deficit became even larger in the late 1990s and into the mid-2000s. However, the trade deficit declined in

2009 after the recession had taken hold, then rebounded partially in 2010 and remained stable up through
2019, before falling again in 2020.

Table 10.4 shows the U.S. trade picture in 2013 compared with some other economies from around the world.

While the U.S. economy has consistently run trade deficits in recent years, Japan and many European nations,

include Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America; Nigeria, along with South Africa competing to be the

largest economy in Africa; and China, India, and Korea. The first column offers one measure of an economy's

globalization: exports of goods and services as a percentage of GDP. The second column shows the trade

balance. Usually, most countries have trade surpluses or deficits that are less than 5% of GDP. As you can see,

the U.S. current account balance is –2.6% of GDP, while Germany's is 8.4% of GDP.

10.3 Trade Balances and Flows of Financial Capital

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain the connection between trade balances and financial capital flows

• Calculate comparative advantage

• Explain balanced trade in terms of investment and capital flows

As economists see it, trade surpluses can be either good or bad, depending on circumstances, and trade

deficits can be good or bad, too. The challenge is to understand how the international flows of goods and

services are connected with international flows of financial capital. In this module we will illustrate the

intimate connection between trade balances and flows of financial capital in two ways: a parable of trade

between Robinson Crusoe and Friday, and a circular flow diagram representing flows of trade and payments.

Access for free at openstax.org

10.3 • Trade Balances and Flows of Financial Capital 255

A Two-Person Economy: Robinson Crusoe and Friday

To understand how economists view trade deficits and surpluses, consider a parable based on the story of

Robinson Crusoe. Crusoe, as you may remember from the classic novel by Daniel Defoe first published in 1719,

was shipwrecked on a desert island. After living alone for some time, he is joined by a second person, whom he

names Friday. Think about the balance of trade in a two-person economy like that of Robinson and Friday.

Robinson and Friday trade goods and services. Perhaps Robinson catches fish and trades them to Friday for

coconuts, or Friday weaves a hat out of tree fronds and trades it to Robinson for help in carrying water. For a

period of time, each individual trade is self-contained and complete. Because each trade is voluntary, both

Robinson and Friday must feel that they are receiving fair value for what they are giving. As a result, each

person’s exports are always equal to his imports, and trade is always in balance between the two. Neither

person experiences either a trade deficit or a trade surplus.

However, one day Robinson approaches Friday with a proposition. Robinson wants to dig ditches for an

irrigation system for his garden, but he knows that if he starts this project, he will not have much time left to

fish and gather coconuts to feed himself each day. He proposes that Friday supply him with a certain number

of fish and coconuts for several months, and then after that time, he promises to repay Friday out of the extra

produce that he will be able to grow in his irrigated garden. If Friday accepts this offer, then a trade imbalance

comes into being. For several months, Friday will have a trade surplus: that is, he is exporting to Robinson

more than he is importing. More precisely, he is giving Robinson fish and coconuts, and at least for the

moment, he is receiving nothing in return. Conversely, Robinson will have a trade deficit, because he is

importing more from Friday than he is exporting.

This parable raises several useful issues in thinking about what a trade deficit and a trade surplus really mean

in economic terms. The first issue that this story of Robinson and Friday raises is this: Is it better to have a

trade surplus or a trade deficit? The answer, as in any voluntary market interaction, is that if both parties agree

to the transaction, then they may both be better off. Over time, if Robinson’s irrigated garden is a success, it is

certainly possible that both Robinson and Friday can benefit from this agreement.

The parable raises a second issue: What can go wrong? Robinson’s proposal to Friday introduces an element of

uncertainty. Friday is, in effect, making a loan of fish and coconuts to Robinson, and Friday’s happiness with

this arrangement will depend on whether Robinson repays that loan as planned, in full and on time. Perhaps

Robinson spends several months loafing and never builds the irrigation system, or perhaps Robinson has been

too optimistic about how much he will be able to grow with the new irrigation system, which turns out not to be

very productive. Perhaps, after building the irrigation system, Robinson decides that he does not want to repay

Friday as much as he previously agreed. Any of these developments will prompt a new round of negotiations

between Friday and Robinson. Why the repayment failed is likely to shape Friday’s attitude toward these
renegotiations. If Robinson worked very hard and the irrigation system just did not increase production as

intended, Friday may have some sympathy. If Robinson loafed or if he just refuses to pay, Friday may become

irritated.

A third issue that the parable raises is that an intimate relationship exists between a trade deficit and

international borrowing, and between a trade surplus and international lending. The size of Friday’s trade

surplus is exactly how much he is lending to Robinson. The size of Robinson’s trade deficit is exactly how much

he is borrowing from Friday. To economists, a trade surplus literally means the same thing as an outflow of

financial capital, and a trade deficit literally means the same thing as an inflow of financial capital. This last

insight is worth exploring in greater detail, which we will do in the following section.

The story of Robinson and Friday also provides a good opportunity to consider the law of comparative

advantage, which you learn more about in the International Trade chapter. The following Work It Out feature

steps you through calculating comparative advantage for the wheat and cloth traded between the United States

and Great Britain in the 1800s.

256 10 • The International Trade and Capital Flows

Calculating Comparative Advantage
In the 1800s, the United States and Britain traded wheat and cloth. Table 10.5 shows the varying hours of labor

per unit of output.

Step 1. Observe from Table 10.5 that, in the United States, it takes eight hours to supply a bushel of wheat and
nine hours to supply a yard of cloth. In contrast, it takes four hours to supply a bushel of wheat and three hours

to supply a yard of cloth in Britain.

Step 2. Recognize the difference between absolute advantage and comparative advantage. Britain has an

absolute advantage (lowest cost) in each good, since it takes a lower amount of labor to make each good in

Britain. Britain also has a comparative advantage in the production of cloth (lower opportunity cost in cloth (3/4

versus 9/8)). The United States has a comparative advantage in wheat production (lower opportunity cost of 8/9

versus 4/3).

Step 3. Determine the relative price of one good in terms of the other good. The price of wheat, in this example, is

the amount of cloth you have to give up. To find this price, convert the hours per unit of wheat and cloth into units

per hour. To do so, observe that in the United States it takes eight hours to make a bushel of wheat, so workers

can process 1/8 of a bushel of wheat in an hour. It takes nine hours to make a yard of cloth in the United States,

so workers can produce 1/9 of a yard of cloth in an hour. If you divide the amount of cloth (1/9 of a yard) by the

amount of wheat you give up (1/8 of a bushel) in an hour, you find the price (8/9) of one good (wheat) in terms of

the other (cloth).

The Balance of Trade as the Balance of Payments

The connection between trade balances and international flows of financial capital is so close that economists

sometimes describe the balance of trade as the balance of payments. Each category of the current account

balance involves a corresponding flow of payments between a given country and the rest of the world economy.

Figure 10.3 shows the flow of goods and services and payments between one country—the United States in this

example—and the rest of the world. The top line shows U.S. exports of goods and services, while the second line

shows financial payments from purchasers in other countries back to the U.S. economy. The third line then

shows U.S. imports of goods, services, and investment, and the fourth line shows payments from the home

home country and investment income (bottom fourth line) flowing from the home country to the rest of the

world. We find the investment income (bottom lines two and four) in the current account, while investment to

the rest of the world or into the home country (lines one and three) is in the financial account. This figure does

not show unilateral transfers, the fourth item in the current account.

FIGURE 10.3 Flow of Investment Goods and Capital Each element of the current account balance involves a flow of

the second line shows the money that the home country receives for those exports. The third line shows imports

that the home country receives; the fourth line shows the payments that the home country sent abroad in exchange

A current account deficit means that, the country is a net borrower from abroad. Conversely, a positive current

account balance means a country is a net lender to the rest of the world. Just like the parable of Robinson and

Friday, the lesson is that a trade surplus means an overall outflow of financial investment capital, as domestic

investors put their funds abroad, while a deficit in the current account balance is exactly equal to the overall or

net inflow of foreign investment capital from abroad.

It is important to recognize that an inflow and outflow of foreign capital does not necessarily refer to a debt that

governments owe to other governments, although government debt may be part of the picture. Instead, these

international flows of financial capital refer to all of the ways in which private investors in one country may

invest in another country—by buying real estate, companies, and financial investments like stocks and bonds.

capital—in the context of the overall levels of savings and financial investment in the economy.

Understanding the Determinants of the Trade and Current Account Balance

The national saving and investment identity provides a useful way to understand the determinants of the

trade and current account balance. In a nation’s financial capital market, the quantity of financial capital

supplied at any given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for purposes of making

investments. What is on the supply and demand sides of financial capital? See the following Clear It Up feature

for the answer to this question.

CLEAR IT UP

What comprises the supply and demand of financial capital?
A country’s national savings is the total of its domestic savings by household and companies (private savings) as

well as the government (public savings). If a country is running a trade deficit, it means money from abroad is

entering the country and the government considers it part of the supply of financial capital.

The demand for financial capital (money) represents groups that are borrowing the money. Businesses need to
borrow to finance their investments in factories, materials, and personnel. When the federal government runs a

budget deficit, it is also borrowing money from investors by selling Treasury bonds. Therefore, both business

investment and the federal government can demand (or borrow) the supply of savings.

There are two main sources for the supply of financial capital in the U.S. economy: saving by individuals and

firms, called S, and the inflow of financial capital from foreign investors, which is equal to the trade deficit (M –

X), or imports minus exports. There are also two main sources of demand for financial capital in the U.S.

economy: private sector investment, I, and government borrowing, where the government needs to borrow

when government spending, G, is higher than the taxes collected, T. We can express this national savings and

investment identity in algebraic terms:

Again, in this equation, S is private savings, T is taxes, G is government spending, M is imports, X is exports,

and I is investment. This relationship is true as a matter of definition because, for the macro economy, the

quantity supplied of financial capital must be equal to the quantity demanded.

However, certain components of the national savings and investment identity can switch between the supply

side and the demand side. Some countries, like the United States in most years since the 1970s, have budget
deficits, which mean the government is spending more than it collects in taxes, and so the government needs

to borrow funds. In this case, the government term would be G – T > 0, showing that spending is larger than

taxes, and the government would be a demander of financial capital on the left-hand side of the equation (that

is, a borrower), not a supplier of financial capital on the right-hand side. However, if the government runs a

budget surplus so that the taxes exceed spending, as the U.S. government did from 1998 to 2001, then the

government in that year was contributing to the supply of financial capital (T – G > 0), and would appear on the

left (saving) side of the national savings and investment identity.

Similarly, if a national economy runs a trade surplus, the trade sector will involve an outflow of financial capital

to other countries. A trade surplus means that the domestic financial capital is in surplus within a country and
can be invested in other countries.

The fundamental notion that total quantity of financial capital demanded equals total quantity of financial

capital supplied must always remain true. Domestic savings will always appear as part of the supply of

financial capital and domestic investment will always appear as part of the demand for financial capital.

10.4 • The National Saving and Investment Identity 259

However, the government and trade balance elements of the equation can move back and forth as either

suppliers or demanders of financial capital, depending on whether government budgets and the trade balance

are in surplus or deficit.

Domestic Saving and Investment Determine the Trade Balance

One insight from the national saving and investment identity is that a nation's own levels of domestic saving

and investment determine a nation’s balance of trade. To understand this point, rearrange the identity to put

the balance of trade all by itself on one side of the equation. Consider first the situation with a trade deficit, and

then the situation with a trade surplus.

In the case of a trade deficit, the national saving and investment identity can be rewritten as:

In this case, domestic investment is higher than domestic saving, including both private and government

saving. The only way that domestic investment can exceed domestic saving is if capital is flowing into a

country from abroad. After all, that extra financial capital for investment has to come from someplace.

Now consider a trade surplusfrom the standpoint of the national saving and investment identity:

In this case, domestic savings (both private and public) is higher than domestic investment. That extra

financial capital will be invested abroad.

This connection of domestic saving and investment to the trade balance explains why economists view the

balance of trade as a fundamentally macroeconomic phenomenon. As the national saving and investment

identity shows, the performance of certain sectors of an economy, like cars or steel, do not determine the trade

balance. Further, whether the nation’s trade laws and regulations encourage free trade or protectionism also

does not determine the trade balance (see Globalization and Protectionism).

Exploring Trade Balances One Factor at a Time

The national saving and investment identity also provides a framework for thinking about what will cause

trade deficits to rise or fall. Begin with the version of the identity that has domestic savings and investment on

the left and the trade deficit on the right:

Now, consider the factors on the left-hand side of the equation one at a time, while holding the other factors

constant.

As a first example, assume that the level of domestic investment in a country rises, while the level of private

and public saving remains unchanged. Table 10.6 shows the result in the first row under the equation. Since

the equality of the national savings and investment identity must continue to hold—it is, after all, an identity

that must be true by definition—the rise in domestic investment will mean a higher trade deficit. This situation

occurred in the U.S. economy in the late 1990s. Because of the surge of new information and communications

technologies that became available, business investment increased substantially. A fall in private saving

during this time and a rise in government saving more or less offset each other. As a result, the financial

capital to fund that business investment came from abroad, which is one reason for the very high U.S. trade

deficits of the late 1990s and early 2000s.

TABLE 10.6 Causes of a Changing Trade Balance

As a second scenario, assume that the level of domestic savings rises, while the level of domestic investment

and public savings remain unchanged. In this case, the trade deficit would decline. As domestic savings rises,
there would be less need for foreign financial capital to meet investment needs. For this reason, a policy

proposal often made for reducing the U.S. trade deficit is to increase private saving—although exactly how to

increase the overall rate of saving has proven controversial.

As a third scenario, imagine that the government budget deficit increased dramatically, while domestic

investment and private savings remained unchanged. This scenario occurred in the U.S. economy in the

mid-1980s. The federal budget deficit increased from $79 billion in 1981 to $221 billion in 1986—an increase

in the demand for financial capital of $142 billion. The current account balance collapsed from a surplus of $5

billion in 1981 to a deficit of $147 billion in 1986—an increase in the supply of financial capital from abroad of

$152 billion. The connection at that time is clear: a sharp increase in government borrowing increased the U.S.

economy’s demand for financial capital, and foreign investors through the trade deficit primarily supplied that

increase. The following Work It Out feature walks you through a scenario in which private domestic savings

has to rise by a certain amount to reduce a trade deficit.

WORK IT OUT

Solving Problems with the Saving and Investment Identity
Use the saving and investment identity to answer the following question: Country A has a trade deficit of $200

billion, private domestic savings of $500 billion, a government deficit of $200 billion, and private domestic

investment of $500 billion. To reduce the $200 billion trade deficit by $100 billion, by how much does private

domestic savings have to increase?

Step 1. Write out the savings investment formula solving for the trade deficit or surplus on the left:

Step 2. In the formula, put the amount for the trade deficit in as a negative number (X – M). The left side of your

formula is now:

Step 3. Enter the private domestic savings (S) of $500 in the formula:

Step 4. Enter the private domestic investment (I) of $500 into the formula:

Access for free at openstax.org

10.4 • The National Saving and Investment Identity 261

Step 5. The government budget surplus or balance is represented by (T – G). Enter a budget deficit amount for (T

– G) of –200:

Step 6. Your formula now is:

The question is: To reduce your trade deficit (X – M) of –200 to –100 (in billions of dollars), by how much will

savings have to rise?

Step 7. Summarize the answer: Private domestic savings needs to rise by $100 billion, to a total of $600 billion,

for the two sides of the equation to remain equal (–100 = –100).

Short-Term Movements in the Business Cycle and the Trade Balance

In the short run, whether an economy is in a recession or on the upswing can affect trade imbalances. A

recession tends to make a trade deficit smaller, or a trade surplus larger, while a period of strong economic

growth tends to make a trade deficit larger, or a trade surplus smaller. These are not hard-and-fast rules,

however.

As an example, note in Figure 10.2 that the U.S. trade deficit declined by almost half from 2006 to 2009. One

primary reason for this change is that during the recession, as the U.S. economy slowed down, it purchased

fewer of all goods, including fewer imports from abroad. However, buying power abroad fell less, and so U.S.

exports did not fall by as much. On the other hand, during the 2020 pandemic-induced recession, the trade

deficit expanded (current account balance plummeted) as the U.S. economy became more reliant on other

countries for goods and services.

Conversely, in the mid-2000s, when the U.S. trade deficit became very large, a contributing short-term reason

is that the U.S. economy was growing. As a result, there was considerable aggressive buying in the U.S.

economy, including the buying of imports. Thus, a trade deficit (or a much lower trade surplus) often

accompanies a rapidly growing domestic economy, while a trade surplus (or a much lower trade deficit)

accompanies a slowing or recessionary domestic economy.

Regardless of whether the trade deficit falls or rises during expansions or downturns, when the trade deficit

rises, it necessarily means a greater net inflow of foreign financial capital. The national saving and investment

identity teaches that the rest of the economy can absorb this inflow of foreign financial capital in several

different ways. For example, reduced private savings could offset the additional inflow of financial capital from

abroad, leaving domestic investment and public saving unchanged. Alternatively, the inflow of foreign

financial capital could result in higher domestic investment, leaving private and public saving unchanged. Yet

another possibility is that greater government borrowing could absorb the inflow of foreign financial capital,

leaving domestic saving and investment unchanged. The national saving and investment identity does not

specify which of these scenarios, alone or in combination, will occur—only that one of them must occur.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•

•

Identify three ways in which borrowing money or running a trade deficit can result in a healthy economy

Identify three ways in which borrowing money or running a trade deficit can result in a weaker economy

Because flows of trade always involve flows of financial payments, flows of international trade are actually the

same as flows of international financial capital. The question of whether trade deficits or surpluses are good or

bad for an economy is, in economic terms, exactly the same question as whether it is a good idea for an

economy to rely on net inflows of financial capital from abroad or to make net investments of financial capital

abroad. Conventional wisdom often holds that borrowing money is foolhardy, and that a prudent country, like a

prudent person, should always rely on its own resources. While it is certainly possible to borrow too much—as

anyone with an overloaded credit card can testify—borrowing at certain times can also make sound economic

sense. For both individuals and countries, there is no economic merit in a policy of abstaining from

participation in financial capital markets.

It makes economic sense to borrow when you are buying something with a long-run payoff; that is, when you

are making an investment. For this reason, it can make economic sense to borrow for a college education,

because the education will typically allow you to earn higher wages, and so to repay the loan and still come out

ahead. It can also make sense for a business to borrow in order to purchase a machine that will last 10 years, as

long as the machine will increase output and profits by more than enough to repay the loan. Similarly, it can

make economic sense for a national economy to borrow from abroad, as long as it wisely invests the money in

ways that will tend to raise the nation’s economic growth over time. Then, it will be possible for the national

economy to repay the borrowed money over time and still end up better off than before.

One vivid example of a country that borrowed heavily from abroad, invested wisely, and did perfectly well is

the United States during the nineteenth century. The United States ran a trade deficit in 40 of the 45 years

from 1831 to 1875, which meant that it was importing capital from abroad over that time. However, that

financial capital was mostly invested in projects like railroads that brought a substantial economic payoff. (See

the following Clear It Up feature for more on this.)

A more recent example along these lines is the experience of South Korea, which had trade deficits during

much of the 1970s—and so was an importer of capital over that time. However, South Korea also had high rates

of investment in physical plant and equipment, and its economy grew rapidly. From the mid-1980s into the

mid-1990s, South Korea often had trade surpluses—that is, it was repaying its past borrowing by sending

capital abroad.

In contrast, some countries have run large trade deficits, borrowed heavily in global capital markets, and

ended up in all kinds of trouble. Two specific sorts of trouble are worth examining. First, a borrower nation can

find itself in a bind if it does not invest the incoming funds from abroad in a way that leads to increased

productivity. Several of Latin America's large economies, including Mexico and Brazil, ran large trade deficits

and borrowed heavily from abroad in the 1970s, but the inflow of financial capital did not boost productivity

sufficiently, which meant that these countries faced enormous troubles repaying the money borrowed when

economic conditions shifted during the 1980s. Similarly, it appears that a number of African nations that

borrowed foreign funds in the 1970s and 1980s did not invest in productive economic assets. As a result,

several of those countries later faced large interest payments, with no economic growth to show for the

borrowed funds.

CLEAR IT UP

Are trade deficits always harmful?
For most years of the nineteenth century, U.S. imports exceeded exports and the U.S. economy had a trade deficit.

Yet the string of trade deficits did not hold back the economy at all. Instead, the trade deficits contributed to the

strong economic growth that gave the U.S. economy the highest per capita GDP in the world by around 1900.

The U.S. trade deficits meant that the U.S. economy was receiving a net inflow of foreign capital from abroad. Much

of that foreign capital flowed into two areas of investment—railroads and public infrastructure like roads, water

systems, and schools—which were important to helping the U.S. economy grow.

We should not overstate the effect of foreign investment capital on U.S. economic growth. In most years the foreign

financial capital represented no more than 6–10% of the funds that the government used for overall physical

investment in the economy. Nonetheless, the trade deficit and the accompanying investment funds from abroad

were clearly a help, not a hindrance, to the U.S. economy in the nineteenth century.

A second “trouble” is: What happens if the foreign money flows in, and then suddenly flows out again? We

raised this scenario at the start of the chapter. In the mid-1990s, a number of countries in East Asia—Thailand,

Indonesia, Malaysia, and South Korea—ran large trade deficits and imported capital from abroad. However, in

1997 and 1998 many foreign investors became concerned about the health of these economies, and quickly

pulled their money out of stock and bond markets, real estate, and banks. The extremely rapid departure of

that foreign capital staggered the banking systems and economies of these countries, plunging them into deep

recession. We investigate and discuss the links between international capital flows, banks, and recession in

The Impacts of Government Borrowing.

While a trade deficit is not always harmful, there is no guarantee that running a trade surplus will bring robust

economic health. For example, Germany and Japan ran substantial trade surpluses for most of the last three

decades. Regardless of their persistent trade surpluses, both countries have experienced occasional recessions

and neither country has had especially robust annual growth in recent years. Read more about Japan’s trade

surplus in the next Clear It Up feature.

LINK IT UP

Watch this video (http://openstax.org/l/tradedeficit) on whether or not trade deficit is good for the economy.

The sheer size and persistence of the U.S. trade deficits and inflows of foreign capital since the 1980s are a

legitimate cause for concern. The huge U.S. economy will not be destabilized by an outflow of international

capital as easily as, say, the comparatively tiny economies of Thailand and Indonesia were in 1997–1998. Even

an economy that is not knocked down, however, can still be shaken. American policymakers should certainly

be paying attention to those cases where a pattern of extensive and sustained current account deficits and

foreign borrowing has gone badly—if only as a cautionary tale.

CLEAR IT UP

Are trade surpluses always beneficial? Considering Japan since the 1990s.
Perhaps no economy around the world is better known for its trade surpluses than Japan. Since 1990, the size of

these surpluses has often been near $100 billion per year. When Japan’s economy was growing vigorously in the

1960s and 1970s, many, especially non-economists, described its large trade surpluses either a cause or a result of

its robust economic health. However, from a standpoint of economic growth, Japan’s economy has been teetering in

and out of recession since 1990, with real GDP growth averaging only about 1% per year, and an unemployment rate

264 10 • The International Trade and Capital Flows

that has been creeping higher. Clearly, a whopping trade surplus is no guarantee of economic good health.

Instead, Japan’s trade surplus reflects that Japan has a very high rate of domestic savings, more than the Japanese

economy can invest domestically, and so it invests the extra funds abroad. In Japan’s slow economy, consumption

of imports is relatively low, and the growth of consumption is relatively slow. Thus, Japan’s exports continually

exceed its imports, leaving the trade surplus continually high. Recently, Japan’s trade surpluses began to

deteriorate. In 2013, Japan ran a trade deficit due to the high cost of imported oil. By 2015, Japan again had a

surplus and continues to run one today.

10.6 The Difference between Level of Trade and the Trade Balance

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•

Identify three factors that influence a country's level of trade

• Differentiate between balance of trade and level of trade

A nation’s levelof trade may at first sound like much the same issue as the balanceof trade, but these two are

actually quite separate. It is perfectly possible for a country to have a very high level of trade—measured by its

exports of goods and services as a share of its GDP—while it also has a near-balance between exports and

imports. A high level of trade indicates that the nation exports a good portion of its production. It is also

possible for a country’s trade to be a relatively low share of GDP, relative to global averages, but for the

imbalance between its exports and its imports to be quite large. We emphasized this general theme earlier in

Measuring Trade Balances, which offered some illustrative figures on trade levels and balances.

A country’s level of trade tells how much of its production it exports. We measure this by the percent of exports

out of GDP. It indicates the degree of an economy's globalization. Some countries, such as Germany, have a

high level of trade—they export almost 50% of their total production. The balance of trade tells us if the country

is running a trade surplus or trade deficit. A country can have a low level of trade but a high trade deficit. (For

example, the United States only exports around 10% of its GDP, but it has a trade deficit of over $600 billion.)

Three factors strongly influence a nation’s level of trade: the size of its economy, its geographic location, and its

history of trade. Large economies like the United States can do much of their trading internally, while small

economies like Sweden have less ability to provide what they want internally and tend to have higher ratios of

exports and imports to GDP. Nations that are neighbors tend to trade more, since costs of transportation and

communication are lower. Moreover, some nations have long and established patterns of international trade,

while others do not.

Consequently, a relatively small economy like Sweden, with many nearby trading partners across Europe and a
long history of foreign trade, has a high level of trade. Brazil and India, which are fairly large economies that

have often sought to inhibit trade in recent decades, have lower levels of trade; whereas, the United States and

Japan are extremely large economies that have comparatively few nearby trading partners. Both countries

actually have quite low levels of trade by world standards. The ratio of exports to GDP in either the United

States or in Japan is about half of the world average.

The balance of trade is a separate issue from the level of trade. The United States has a low level of trade, but

had enormous trade deficits for most years from the mid-1980s into the 2000s. Japan has a low level of trade

by world standards, but has typically shown large trade surpluses in recent decades. Nations like Germany and

the United Kingdom have medium to high levels of trade by world standards, but Germany had a moderate

trade surplus in 2020, while the United Kingdom had a moderate trade deficit. Their trade picture was roughly

in balance in the late 1990s. Sweden had a high level of trade and a moderate trade surplus in 2020, while

Canada had a high level of trade and a moderate trade deficit that same year.

In short, it is quite possible for nations with a relatively low level of trade, expressed as a percentage of GDP, to

Access for free at openstax.org

10.6 • The Difference between Level of Trade and the Trade Balance 265

have relatively large trade deficits. It is also quite possible for nations with a near balance between exports and

imports to worry about the consequences of high levels of trade for the economy. It is not inconsistent to

believe that a high level of trade is potentially beneficial to an economy, because of the way it allows nations to

play to their comparative advantages, and to also be concerned about any macroeconomic instability caused

by a long-term pattern of large trade deficits. The following Clear It Up feature discusses how this sort of

dynamic played out in Colonial India.

CLEAR IT UP

Are trade surpluses always beneficial? Considering Colonial India.
India was formally under British rule from 1858 to 1947. During that time, India consistently had trade surpluses

with Great Britain. Anyone who believes that trade surpluses are a sign of economic strength and dominance while

trade deficits are a sign of economic weakness must find this pattern odd, since it would mean that colonial India

was successfully dominating and exploiting Great Britain for almost a century—which was not true.

Instead, India’s trade surpluses with Great Britain meant that each year there was an overall flow of financial capital

from India to Great Britain. In India, many heavily criticized this financial capital flow as the “drain,” and they viewed

eliminating the financial capital drain as one of the many reasons why India would benefit from achieving

independence.

Final Thoughts about Trade Balances

Trade deficits can be a good or a bad sign for an economy, and trade surpluses can be a good or a bad sign.

Even a trade balance of zero—which just means that a nation is neither a net borrower nor lender in the

international economy—can be either a good or bad sign. The fundamental economic question is not whether a

nation’s economy is borrowing or lending at all, but whether the particular borrowing or lending in the

particular economic conditions of that country makes sense.

It is interesting to reflect on how public attitudes toward trade deficits and surpluses might change if we could

somehow change the labels that people and the news media affix to them. If we called a trade deficit “attracting

foreign financial capital”—which accurately describes what a trade deficit means—then trade deficits might

look more attractive. Conversely, if we called a trade surplus “shipping financial capital abroad”—which

accurately captures what a trade surplus does—then trade surpluses might look less attractive. Either way, the

key to understanding trade balances is to understand the relationships between flows of trade and flows of

international payments, and what these relationships imply about the causes, benefits, and risks of different

kinds of trade balances. The first step along this journey of understanding is to move beyond knee-jerk

reactions to terms like “trade surplus,” “trade balance,” and “trade deficit.”

BRING IT HOME

More than Meets the Eye in the Congo
Now that you see the big picture, you undoubtedly realize that all of the economic choices you make, such as

depositing savings or investing in an international mutual fund, do influence the flow of goods and services as well

as the flows of money around the world.

You now know that a trade surplus does not necessarily tell us whether an economy is performing well or not. The

Democratic Republic of the Congo ran a trade surplus in 2013, as we learned in the beginning of the chapter. Yet its

current account balance was –$2.8 billion. However, the return of political stability and the rebuilding in the

aftermath of the civil war there has meant a flow of investment and financial capital into the country. In this case, a

negative current account balance means the country is being rebuilt—and that is a good thing.

Key Concepts and Summary

10.1 Measuring Trade Balances

The trade balance measures the gap between a country’s exports and its imports. In most high-income
economies, goods comprise less than half of a country’s total production, while services comprise more than

half. The last two decades have seen a surge in international trade in services; however, most global trade still

takes the form of goods rather than services. The current account balance includes the trade in goods,

services, and money flowing into and out of a country from investments and unilateral transfers.

10.2 Trade Balances in Historical and International Context

The United States developed large trade surpluses in the early 1980s, swung back to a tiny trade surplus in

1991, and then had even larger trade deficits in the late 1990s and early 2000s. As we will see below, a trade

deficit necessarily means a net inflow of financial capital from abroad, while a trade surplus necessarily means

a net outflow of financial capital from an economy to other countries.

10.3 Trade Balances and Flows of Financial Capital

International flows of goods and services are closely connected to the international flows of financial capital. A

current account deficit means that, after taking all the flows of payments from goods, services, and income

together, the country is a net borrower from the rest of the world. A current account surplus is the opposite and

means the country is a net lender to the rest of the world.

10.4 The National Saving and Investment Identity

The national saving and investment identity is based on the relationship that the total quantity of financial
capital supplied from all sources must equal the total quantity of financial capital demanded from all sources.

If S is private saving, T is taxes, G is government spending, M is imports, X is exports, and I is investment, then

for an economy with a current account deficit and a budget deficit:

A recession tends to increase the trade balance (meaning a higher trade surplus or lower trade deficit), while

economic boom will tend to decrease the trade balance (meaning a lower trade surplus or a larger trade

deficit).

10.5 The Pros and Cons of Trade Deficits and Surpluses

Trade surpluses are no guarantee of economic health, and trade deficits are no guarantee of economic

weakness. Either trade deficits or trade surpluses can work out well or poorly, depending on whether a

government wisely invests the corresponding flows of financial capital.

10.6 The Difference between Level of Trade and the Trade Balance

There is a difference between the level of a country’s trade and the balance of trade. The government measures

its level of trade by the percentage of exports out of GDP, or the size of the economy. Small economies that have

nearby trading partners and a history of international trade will tend to have higher levels of trade. Larger

economies with few nearby trading partners and a limited history of international trade will tend to have lower

levels of trade. The level of trade is different from the trade balance. The level of trade depends on a country’s

history of trade, its geography, and the size of its economy. A country’s balance of trade is the dollar difference

between its exports and imports.

Trade deficits and trade surpluses are not necessarily good or bad—it depends on the circumstances. Even if a

country is borrowing, if it invests that money in productivity-boosting investments it can lead to an

improvement in long-term economic growth.

Introduction to the Aggregate Supply–Aggregate Demand Model

BRING IT HOME

From Housing Bubble to Housing Bust
The United States experienced rising home ownership rates for most of the last two decades. Between 1990 and

2006, the U.S. housing market grew. Homeownership rates grew from 64% to a high of over 69% between 2004 and

2005. For many people, this was a period in which they could either buy first homes or buy a larger and more

expensive home. During this time mortgage values tripled. Housing became more accessible to Americans and was

considered to be a safe financial investment. Figure 11.2 shows how new single family home sales peaked in 2005

at 1,279,000 units.

272 11 • The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model

FIGURE 11.2 New Single Family Houses Sold From the early 1990s up through 2005, the number of new single

family houses sold rose steadily. In 2006, the number dropped dramatically and this dramatic decline continued

through 2011. Beginning in 2012, the number of new houses sold began to climb back up. (Source: U.S. Census

Bureau)

The housing bubble began to show signs of bursting in 2005, as delinquency and late payments began to grow and

an oversupply of new homes on the market became apparent. Dropping home values contributed to a decrease in

the overall wealth of the household sector and caused homeowners to pull back on spending. Several mortgage

lenders were forced to file for bankruptcy because homeowners were not making their payments, and by 2008 the

problem had spread throughout the financial markets. Lenders clamped down on credit and the housing bubble

burst. Financial markets were now in crisis and unable or unwilling to even extend credit to credit-worthy

customers.

The housing bubble and the crisis in the financial markets were major contributors to the Great Recession that led to

unemployment rates over 10% and falling GDP. While the United States is still recovering from the impact of the

Great Recession, it has made substantial progress in restoring financial market stability through implementing

aggressive fiscal and monetary policy.

The economic history of the United States is cyclical in nature with recessions and expansions. Some of these

fluctuations are severe, such as the economic downturn that occurred during the Great Depression in the 1930s

which lasted several years. Why does the economy grow at different rates in different years? What are the causes of

the cyclical behavior of the economy? This chapter will introduce an important model, the aggregate

demand–aggregate supply model, to begin our understanding of why economies expand and contract over time.

New One-Family Houses Sold in the United States.

A key part of macroeconomics is the use of models to analyze macro issues and problems. How is the rate of

economic growth connected to changes in the unemployment rate? Is there a reason why unemployment and

inflation seem to move in opposite directions: lower unemployment and higher inflation from 1997 to 2000,

higher unemployment and lower inflation in the early 2000s, lower unemployment and higher inflation in the

mid-2000s, and then higher unemployment and lower inflation in 2009? Why did the current account deficit

rise so high, but then decline in 2009?

To analyze questions like these, we must move beyond discussing macroeconomic issues one at a time, and

begin building economic models that will capture the relationships and interconnections between them. The

next three chapters take up this task. This chapter introduces the macroeconomic model of aggregate supply

and aggregate demand, how the two interact to reach a macroeconomic equilibrium, and how shifts in

aggregate demand or aggregate supply will affect that equilibrium. This chapter also relates the model of

aggregate supply and aggregate demand to the three goals of economic policy (growth, unemployment, and

inflation), and provides a framework for thinking about many of the connections and tradeoffs between these

goals. The chapter on The Keynesian Perspective focuses on the macroeconomy in the short run, where

aggregate demand plays a crucial role. The chapter on The Neoclassical Perspective explores the

macroeconomy in the long run, where aggregate supply plays a crucial role.

11.1 Macroeconomic Perspectives on Demand and Supply

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain Say’s Law and understand why it primarily applies in the long run

• Explain Keynes’ Law and understand why it primarily applies in the short run

Macroeconomists over the last two centuries have often divided into two groups: those who argue that supply

is the most important determinant of the size of the macroeconomy while demand just tags along, and those

who argue that demand is the most important factor in the size of the macroeconomy while supply just tags

along.

Say’s Law and the Macroeconomics of Supply

Those economists who emphasize the role of supply in the macroeconomy often refer to the work of a famous

early nineteenth century French economist named Jean-Baptiste Say (1767–1832). Say’s law is: “Supply

creates its own demand.” As a matter of historical accuracy, it seems clear that Say never actually wrote down

this law and that it oversimplifies his beliefs, but the law lives on as useful shorthand for summarizing a point

of view.

The intuition behind Say’s law is that each time a good or service is produced and sold, it generates income

that is earned for someone: a worker, a manager, an owner, or those who are workers, managers, and owners at

firms that supply inputs along the chain of production. We alluded to this earlier in our discussion of the

National Income approach to measuring GDP. The forces of supply and demand in individual markets will

cause prices to rise and fall. The bottom line remains, however, that every sale represents income to someone,

and so, Say’s law argues, a given value of supply must create an equivalent value of demand somewhere else in

the economy. Because Jean-Baptiste Say, Adam Smith, and other economists writing around the turn of the

nineteenth century who discussed this view were known as “classical” economists, modern economists who

generally subscribe to the Say’s law view on the importance of supply for determining the size of the

macroeconomy are called neoclassical economists.

If supply always creates exactly enough demand at the macroeconomic level, then (as Say himself recognized)

it is hard to understand why periods of recession and high unemployment should ever occur. To be sure, even

if total supply always creates an equal amount of total demand, the economy could still experience a situation
of some firms earning profits while other firms suffer losses. Nevertheless, a recession is not a situation where

all business failures are exactly counterbalanced by an offsetting number of successes. A recession is a

situation in which the economy as a whole is shrinking in size, business failures outnumber the remaining

success stories, and many firms end up suffering losses and laying off workers.

Say’s law that supply creates its own demand does seem a good approximation for the long run. Over periods

of some years or decades, as the productive power of an economy to supply goods and services increases, total

demand in the economy grows at roughly the same pace. However, over shorter time horizons of a few months

or even years, recessions or even depressions occur in which firms, as a group, seem to face a lack of demand

for their products.

Keynes’ Law and the Macroeconomics of Demand

The alternative to Say’s law, with its emphasis on supply, is Keynes’ law: “Demand creates its own supply.” As a

matter of historical accuracy, just as Jean-Baptiste Say never wrote down anything as simpleminded as Say’s

law, John Maynard Keynes never wrote down Keynes’ law, but the law is a useful simplification that conveys a

274 11 • The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model

certain point of view.

When Keynes wrote his influential work The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Moneyduring the

1930s Great Depression, he pointed out that during the Depression, the economy's capacity to supply goods

and services had not changed much. U.S. unemployment rates soared higher than 20% from 1933 to 1935, but

the number of possible workers had not increased or decreased much. Factories closed, but machinery and

equipment had not disappeared. Technologies that had been invented in the 1920s were not un-invented and

forgotten in the 1930s. Thus, Keynes argued that the Great Depression—and many ordinary recessions as

well—were not caused by a drop in the ability of the economy to supply goods as measured by labor, physical

capital, or technology. He argued the economy often produced less than its full potential, not because it was

technically impossible to produce more with the existing workers and machines, but because a lack of demand

in the economy as a whole led to inadequate incentives for firms to produce. In such cases, he argued, the level

of GDP in the economy was not primarily determined by the potential of what the economy could supply, but

rather by the amount of total demand.

Keynes’ law seems to apply fairly well in the short run of a few months to a few years, when many firms

experience either a drop in demand for their output during a recession or so much demand that they have
trouble producing enough during an economic boom. However, demand cannot tell the whole macroeconomic
story, either. After all, if demand was all that mattered at the macroeconomic level, then the government could

make the economy as large as it wanted just by pumping up total demand through a large increase in the

government spending component or by legislating large tax cuts to push up the consumption component.

Economies do, however, face genuine limits to how much they can produce, limits determined by the quantity

of labor, physical capital, technology, and the institutional and market structures that bring these factors of

production together. These constraints on what an economy can supply at the macroeconomic level do not

disappear just because of an increase in demand.

Combining Supply and Demand in Macroeconomics

Two insights emerge from this overview of Say’s law with its emphasis on macroeconomic supply and Keynes’

law with its emphasis on macroeconomic demand. The first conclusion, which is not exactly a hot news flash,

is that an economic approach focused only on the supply side or only on the demand side can be only a partial

success. We need to take into account both supply and demand. The second conclusion is that since Keynes’

law applies more accurately in the short run and Say’s law applies more accurately in the long run, the

tradeoffs and connections between the three goals of macroeconomics may be different in the short run and

the long run.

11.2 Building a Model of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain the aggregate supply curve and how it relates to real GDP and potential GDP

• Explain the aggregate demand curve and how it is influenced by price levels

•

•

Interpret the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model

Identify the point of equilibrium in the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model

• Define short run aggregate supply and long run aggregate supply

To build a useful macroeconomic model, we need a model that shows what determines total supply or total

demand for the economy, and how total demand and total supply interact at the macroeconomic level. We call

this the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model. This module will explain aggregate supply, aggregate

demand, and the equilibrium between them. The following modules will discuss the causes of shifts in

aggregate supply and aggregate demand.

11.2 • Building a Model of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply 275

The Aggregate Supply Curve and Potential GDP

Firms make decisions about what quantity to supply based on the profits they expect to earn. They determine

profits, in turn, by the price of the outputs they sell and by the prices of the inputs, like labor or raw materials,

that they need to buy. Aggregate supply (AS) refers to the total quantity of output (i.e. real GDP) firms will

produce and sell. The aggregate supply (AS) curve shows the total quantity of output (i.e. real GDP) that firms

will produce and sell at each price level.

Figure 11.3 shows an aggregate supply curve. In the following paragraphs, we will walk through the elements

of the diagram one at a time: the horizontal and vertical axes, the aggregate supply curve itself, and the

meaning of the potential GDP vertical line.

FIGURE 11.3 The Aggregate Supply Curve Aggregate supply (AS) slopes up, because as the price level for outputs

rises, with the price of inputs remaining fixed, firms have an incentive to produce more to earn higher profits. The

potential GDP line shows the maximum that the economy can produce with full employment of workers and physical

capital.

The diagram's horizontal axis shows real GDP—that is, the level of GDP adjusted for inflation. The vertical axis

shows the price level, which measures the average price of all goods and services produced in the economy. In

other words, the price level in the AD-AS model is what we called the GDP Deflator in The Macroeconomic

Perspective. Remember that the price level is different from the inflation rate. Visualize the price level as an

index number, like the Consumer Price Index, while the inflation rate is the percentage change in the price
level over time.

As the price level rises, real GDP rises as well. Why? The price level on the vertical axis represents prices for

final goods or outputs bought in the economy—i.e. the GDP deflator—not the price level for intermediate goods

and services that are inputs to production. Thus, the AS curve describes how suppliers will react to a higher

price level for final outputs of goods and services, while holding the prices of inputs like labor and energy

constant. If firms across the economy face a situation where the price level of what they produce and sell is

rising, but their costs of production are not rising, then the lure of higher profits will induce them to expand

production. In other words, an aggregate supply curve shows how producers as a group will respond to an

increase in aggregate demand.

An AS curve's slope changes from nearly flat at its far left to nearly vertical at its far right. At the far left of the

aggregate supply curve, the level of output in the economy is far below potential GDP, which we define as the

amount of real GDP an economy can produce by fully employing its existing levels of labor, physical capital,

and technology, in the context of its existing market and legal institutions. At these relatively low levels of

output, levels of unemployment are high, and many factories are running only part-time, or have closed their

276 11 • The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model

doors. In this situation, a relatively small increase in the prices of the outputs that businesses sell—while

assuming no rise in input prices—can encourage a considerable surge in the quantity of aggregate supply

because so many workers and factories are ready to swing into production.

As the GDP increases, however, some firms and industries will start running into limits: perhaps nearly all of

the expert workers in a certain industry will have jobs or factories in certain geographic areas or industries

will be running at full speed. In the AS curve's intermediate area, a higher price level for outputs continues to

encourage a greater quantity of output—but as the increasingly steep upward slope of the aggregate supply

curve shows, the increase in real GDP in response to a given rise in the price level will not be as large. (Read the

following Clear It Up feature to learn why the AS curve crosses potential GDP.)

CLEAR IT UP

Why does AS cross potential GDP?
Economists typically draw the aggregate supply curve to cross the potential GDP line. This shape may seem

puzzling: How can an economy produce at an output level which is higher than its “potential” or “full employment”

GDP? The economic intuition here is that if prices for outputs were high enough, producers would make fanatical

efforts to produce: all workers would be on double-overtime, all machines would run 24 hours a day, seven days a

week. Such hyper-intense production would go beyond using potential labor and physical capital resources fully, to

using them in a way that is not sustainable in the long term. Thus, it is possible for production to sprint above

potential GDP, but only in the short run.

At the far right, the aggregate supply curve becomes nearly vertical. At this quantity, higher prices for outputs

cannot encourage additional output, because even if firms want to expand output, the inputs of labor and

machinery in the economy are fully employed. In this example, the vertical line in the exhibit shows that

potential GDP occurs at a total output of 9,500. When an economy is operating at its potential GDP, machines

and factories are running at capacity, and the unemployment rate is relatively low—at the natural rate of

unemployment. For this reason, potential GDP is sometimes also called full-employment GDP.

The Aggregate Demand Curve

Aggregate demand (AD) refers to the amount of total spending on domestic goods and services in an

economy. (Strictly speaking, AD is what economists call total planned expenditure. We will further explain this

distinction in the appendix The Expenditure-Output Model . For now, just think of aggregate demand as total

spending.) It includes all four components of demand: consumption, investment, government spending, and

net exports (exports minus imports). This demand is determined by a number of factors, but one of them is the

price level—recall though, that the price level is an index number such as the GDP deflator that measures the

average price of the things we buy. The aggregate demand (AD) curve shows the total spending on domestic

goods and services at each price level.

Figure 11.4 presents an aggregate demand (AD) curve. Just like the aggregate supply curve, the horizontal axis

shows real GDP and the vertical axis shows the price level. The AD curve slopes down, which means that

increases in the price level of outputs lead to a lower quantity of total spending. The reasons behind this shape

are related to how changes in the price level affect the different components of aggregate demand. The

following components comprise aggregate demand: consumption spending (C), investment spending (I),

government spending (G), and spending on exports (X) minus imports (M): C + I + G + X – M.

11.2 • Building a Model of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply 277

FIGURE 11.4 The Aggregate Demand Curve Aggregate demand (AD) slopes down, showing that, as the price level

rises, the amount of total spending on domestic goods and services declines.

The wealth effect holds that as the price level increases, the buying power of savings that people have stored up

in bank accounts and other assets will diminish, eaten away to some extent by inflation. Because a rise in the

price level reduces people’s wealth, consumption spending will fall as the price level rises.

The interest rate effect is that as prices for outputs rise, the same purchases will take more money or credit to

accomplish. This additional demand for money and credit will push interest rates higher. In turn, higher

interest rates will reduce borrowing by businesses for investment purposes and reduce borrowing by

households for homes and cars—thus reducing consumption and investment spending.

The foreign price effect points out that if prices rise in the United States while remaining fixed in other

countries, then goods in the United States will be relatively more expensive compared to goods in the rest of

the world. U.S. exports will be relatively more expensive, and the quantity of exports sold will fall. U.S. imports

from abroad will be relatively cheaper, so the quantity of imports will rise. Thus, a higher domestic price level,

relative to price levels in other countries, will reduce net export expenditures.

Among economists all three of these effects are controversial, in part because they do not seem to be very

large. For this reason, the aggregate demand curve in Figure 11.4 slopes downward fairly steeply. The steep

slope indicates that a higher price level for final outputs reduces aggregate demand for all three of these

reasons, but that the change in the quantity of aggregate demand as a result of changes in price level is not

very large.

Supply

To begin to use the AD/AS model, it is important to plot the AS and AD curves from the data provided. What is the

equilibrium?

Step 1. Draw your x- and y-axis. Label the x-axis Real GDP and the y-axis Price Level.

Step 2. Plot AD on your graph.

Step 3. Plot AS on your graph.

Step 4. Look at Figure 11.5 which provides a visual to aid in your analysis.

FIGURE 11.5 The AD/AS Curves AD and AS curves created from the data in Table 11.1.

Step 5. Determine where AD and AS intersect. This is the equilibrium with price level at 130 and real GDP at

$680.

Step 6. Look at the graph to determine where equilibrium is located. We can see that this equilibrium is fairly far

from where the AS curve becomes near-vertical (or at least quite steep) which seems to start at about $750 of

real output. This implies that the economy is not close to potential GDP. Thus, unemployment will be high. In the

relatively flat part of the AS curve, where the equilibrium occurs, changes in the price level will not be a major

concern, since such changes are likely to be small.

Step 7. Determine what the steep portion of the AS curve indicates. Where the AS curve is steep, the economy is

at or close to potential GDP.

Step 8. Draw conclusions from the given information:

•

•

If equilibrium occurs in the flat range of AS, then economy is not close to potential GDP and will be

experiencing unemployment, but stable price level.

If equilibrium occurs in the steep range of AS, then the economy is close or at potential GDP and will be

experiencing rising price levels or inflationary pressures, but will have a low unemployment rate.

Equilibrium in the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model

The intersection of the aggregate supply and aggregate demand curves shows the equilibrium level of real GDP

and the equilibrium price level in the economy. At a relatively low price level for output, firms have little

incentive to produce, although consumers would be willing to purchase a large quantity of output. As the price

level rises, aggregate supply rises and aggregate demand falls until the equilibrium point is reached.

Figure 11.6 combines the AS curve from Figure 11.3 and the AD curve from Figure 11.4 and places them both
on a single diagram. In this example, the equilibrium point occurs at point E, at a price level of 90 and an

output level of 8,800.

FIGURE 11.6 Aggregate Supply and Aggregate Demand The equilibrium, where aggregate supply (AS) equals

aggregate demand (AD), occurs at a price level of 90 and an output level of 8,800.

Confusion sometimes arises between the aggregate supply and aggregate demand model and the

microeconomic analysis of demand and supply in particular markets for goods, services, labor, and capital.

Read the following Clear It Up feature to gain an understanding of whether AS and AD are macro or micro.

CLEAR IT UP

Are AS and AD macro or micro?
These aggregate supply and demand models and the microeconomic analysis of demand and supply in particular

markets for goods, services, labor, and capital have a superficial resemblance, but they also have many underlying

differences.

For example, the vertical and horizontal axes have distinctly different meanings in macroeconomic and

280 11 • The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model

microeconomic diagrams. The vertical axis of a microeconomic demand and supply diagram expresses a price (or

wage or rate of return) for an individual good or service. This price is implicitly relative: it is intended to be compared

with the prices of other products (for example, the price of pizza relative to the price of fried chicken). In contrast,

the vertical axis of an aggregate supply and aggregate demand diagram expresses the level of a price index like the

Consumer Price Index or the GDP deflator—combining a wide array of prices from across the economy. The price

level is absolute: it is not intended to be compared to any other prices since it is essentially the average price of all

products in an economy. The horizontal axis of a microeconomic supply and demand curve measures the quantity of

a particular good or service. In contrast, the horizontal axis of the aggregate demand and aggregate supply diagram

measures GDP, which is the sum of all the final goods and services produced in the economy, not the quantity in a

specific market.

In addition, the economic reasons for the shapes of the curves in the macroeconomic model are different from the

reasons behind the shapes of the curves in microeconomic models. Demand curves for individual goods or services

slope down primarily because of the existence of substitute goods, not the wealth effects, interest rate, and foreign

price effects associated with aggregate demand curves. The slopes of individual supply and demand curves can

have a variety of different slopes, depending on the extent to which quantity demanded and quantity supplied react

to price in that specific market, but the slopes of the AS and AD curves are much the same in every diagram

(although as we shall see in later chapters, short-run and long-run perspectives will emphasize different parts of the

AS curve).

In short, just because the AD/AS diagram has two lines that cross, do not assume that it is the same as every other

diagram where two lines cross. The intuitions and meanings of the macro and micro diagrams are only distant

cousins from different branches of the economics family tree.

Defining SRAS and LRAS

In the Clear It Up feature titled “Why does AS cross potential GDP?” we differentiated between short run

changes in aggregate supply which the AS curve shows and long run changes in aggregate supply which the

vertical line at potential GDP defines. In the short run, if demand is too low (or too high), it is possible for

producers to supply less GDP (or more GDP) than potential. In the long run, however, producers are limited to

producing at potential GDP. For this reason, we may also refer to what we have been calling the AS curve as the

short run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve. We may also refer to the vertical line at potential GDP as the long

run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve.

11.3 Shifts in Aggregate Supply

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain how productivity growth changes the aggregate supply curve

• Explain how changes in input prices change the aggregate supply curve

The original equilibrium in the AD/AS diagram will shift to a new equilibrium if the AS or AD curve shifts.

When the aggregate supply curve shifts to the right, then at every price level, producers supply a greater

quantity of real GDP. When the AS curve shifts to the left, then at every price level, producers supply a lower

quantity of real GDP. This module discusses two of the most important factors that can lead to shifts in the AS

curve: productivity growth and changes in input prices.

How Productivity Growth Shifts the AS Curve

In the long run, the most important factor shifting the AS curve is productivity growth. Productivity means

how much output can be produced with a given quantity of labor. One measure of this is output per worker or

GDP per capita. Over time, productivity grows so that the same quantity of labor can produce more output.

Historically, the real growth in GDP per capita in an advanced economy like the United States has averaged

Access for free at openstax.org

11.3 • Shifts in Aggregate Supply 281

about 2% to 3% per year, but productivity growth has been faster during certain extended periods like the

1960s and the late 1990s through the early 2000s, or slower during periods like the 1970s. A higher level of

productivity shifts the AS curve to the right, because with improved productivity, firms can produce a greater

quantity of output at every price level. Figure 11.7 (a) shows an outward shift in productivity over two time
periods. The AS curve shifts out from SRAS0 to SRAS1 to SRAS2, and the equilibrium shifts from E0 to E1 to E2.
Note that with increased productivity, workers can produce more GDP. Thus, full employment corresponds to a
higher level of potential GDP, which we show as a rightward shift in LRAS from LRAS0 to LRAS1 to LRAS2.

FIGURE 11.7 Shifts in Aggregate Supply (a) The rise in productivity causes the SRAS curve to shift to the right. The
original equilibrium E0 is at the intersection of AD and SRAS0. When SRAS shifts right, then the new equilibrium E1 is
at the intersection of AD and SRAS1, and then yet another equilibrium, E2, is at the intersection of AD and SRAS2.
Shifts in SRAS to the right, lead to a greater level of output and to downward pressure on the price level. (b) A higher

price for inputs means that at any given price level for outputs, a lower real GDP will be produced so aggregate
supply will shift to the left from SRAS0 to SRAS1. The new equilibrium, E1, has a reduced quantity of output and a
higher price level than the original equilibrium (E0).

A shift in the SRAS curve to the right will result in a greater real GDP and downward pressure on the price
level, if aggregate demand remains unchanged. However, if this shift in SRAS results from gains in productivity

growth, which we typically measure in terms of a few percentage points per year, the effect will be relatively

small over a few months or even a couple of years. Recall how in Choice in a World of Scarcity, we said that a

nation's production possibilities frontier is fixed in the short run, but shifts out in the long run? This is the

same phenomenon using a different model.

How Changes in Input Prices Shift the AS Curve

Higher prices for inputs that are widely used across the entire economy can have a macroeconomic impact on

aggregate supply. Examples of such widely used inputs include labor and energy products. Increases in the

price of such inputs will cause the SRAS curve to shift to the left, which means that at each given price level for

outputs, a higher price for inputs will discourage production because it will reduce the possibilities for earning
profits. Figure 11.7 (b) shows the aggregate supply curve shifting to the left, from SRAS0 to SRAS1, causing the
equilibrium to move from E0 to E1. The movement from the original equilibrium of E0 to the new equilibrium
of E1 will bring a nasty set of effects: reduced GDP or recession, higher unemployment because the economy is

282 11 • The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model

now further away from potential GDP, and an inflationary higher price level as well. For example, the U.S.

economy experienced recessions in 1974–1975, 1980–1982, 1990–91, 2001, and 2007–2009 that were each

preceded or accompanied by a rise in the key input of oil prices. In the 1970s, this pattern of a shift to the left

in SRAS leading to a stagnant economy with high unemployment and inflation was nicknamed stagflation.

Conversely, a decline in the price of a key input like oil will shift the SRAS curve to the right, providing an

incentive for more to be produced at every given price level for outputs. From 1985 to 1986, for example, the

average price of crude oil fell by almost half, from $24 a barrel to $12 a barrel. Similarly, from 1997 to 1998,

the price of a barrel of crude oil dropped from $17 per barrel to $11 per barrel. In both cases, the plummeting

oil price led to a situation like that which we presented earlier in Figure 11.7 (a), where the outward shift of

SRAS to the right allowed the economy to expand, unemployment to fall, and inflation to decline.

Along with energy prices, two other key inputs that may shift the SRAS curve are the cost of labor, or wages,

and the cost of imported goods that we use as inputs for other products. In these cases as well, the lesson is

that lower prices for inputs cause SRAS to shift to the right, while higher prices cause it to shift back to the left.

Note that, unlike changes in productivity, changes in input prices do not generally cause LRAS to shift, only

SRAS.

Other Supply Shocks

The aggregate supply curve can also shift due to shocks to input goods or labor. For example, an unexpected

early freeze could destroy a large number of agricultural crops, a shock that would shift the AS curve to the left

since there would be fewer agricultural products available at any given price.

Similarly, shocks to the labor market can affect aggregate supply. An extreme example might be an overseas

war that required a large number of workers to cease their ordinary production in order to go fight for their

country. In this case, SRAS and LRAS would both shift to the left because there would be fewer workers

available to produce goods at any given price.

Another example in this vein is a pandemic, like the COVID-19 pandemic. A pandemic causes many workers to

become sick, temporarily reducing the supply of workers by a large amount. Further, workers might be

cautious to go back to work in a pandemic because of health or safety concerns. While the shock to labor

supply might not be permanent, it can cause a reduction in the supply of many goods and services, reflected in

a leftward shift in the short-run aggregate supply curve. At various points during the COVID-19-induced

pandemic, computer chips for automobiles, meat, and other consumer services were in short supply because

of worker shortages around the world.

11.4 Shifts in Aggregate Demand

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain how imports influence aggregate demand

•

Identify ways in which business confidence and consumer confidence can affect aggregate demand

• Explain how government policy can change aggregate demand

• Evaluate why economists disagree on the topic of tax cuts

As we mentioned previously, the components of aggregate demand are consumption spending (C), investment

spending (I), government spending (G), and spending on exports (X) minus imports (M). (Read the following

Clear It Up feature for explanation of why imports are subtracted from exports and what this means for

aggregate demand.) A shift of the AD curve to the right means that at least one of these components increased

so that a greater amount of total spending would occur at every price level. A shift of the AD curve to the left

means that at least one of these components decreased so that a lesser amount of total spending would occur

at every price level. The Keynesian Perspective will discuss the components of aggregate demand and the

factors that affect them. Here, the discussion will sketch two broad categories that could cause AD curves to

Access for free at openstax.org

11.4 • Shifts in Aggregate Demand 283

shift: changes in consumer or firm behavior and changes in government tax or spending policy.

CLEAR IT UP

Do imports diminish aggregate demand?
We have seen that the formula for aggregate demand is AD = C + I + G + X - M, where M is the total value of imported

goods. Why is there a minus sign in front of imports? Does this mean that more imports will result in a lower level of

aggregate demand? The short answer is yes, because aggregate demand is defined as total demand for domestically

produced goods and services.

When an American buys a foreign product, for example, it gets counted along with all the other consumption. Thus,

the income generated does not go to American producers, but rather to producers in another country. It would be

wrong to count this as part of domestic demand. Therefore, imports added in consumption are subtracted back out

in the M term of the equation.

Because of the way in which we write the demand equation, it is easy to make the mistake of thinking that imports

are bad for the economy. Just keep in mind that every negative number in the M term has a corresponding positive

number in the C or I or G term, and they always cancel out.

How Changes by Consumers and Firms Can Affect AD

When consumers feel more confident about the future of the economy, they tend to consume more. If business

confidence is high, then firms tend to spend more on investment, believing that the future payoff from that

investment will be substantial. Conversely, if consumer or business confidence drops, then consumption and

investment spending decline.

The University of Michigan publishes a survey of consumer confidence and constructs an index of consumer

confidence each month. The survey results are then reported at http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu

(http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/), which break down the change in consumer confidence among different

income levels. According to that index, consumer confidence averaged around 90 prior to the Great Recession,

and then it fell to below 60 in late 2008, which was the lowest it had been since 1980. During the 2010s,

confidence has climbed from a 2011 low of 55.8 back to a level in the upper 90s, before falling to the lower 70s

in 2020 due to the COIVD-19 pandemic, which economists consider close to a healthy state.

The Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD) publishes one measure of business

confidence: the "business tendency surveys". The OECD collects business opinion survey data for 21 countries

on future selling prices and employment, among other business climate elements. After sharply declining

during the Great Recession, the measure has risen above zero again and is back to long-term averages (the

indicator dips below zero when business outlook is weaker than usual). Of course, either of these survey

measures is not very precise. They can however, suggest when confidence is rising or falling, as well as when it

is relatively high or low compared to the past.

Because economists associate a rise in confidence with higher consumption and investment demand, it will
lead to an outward shift in the AD curve, and a move of the equilibrium, from E0 to E1, to a higher quantity of
output and a higher price level, as Figure 11.8 (a) shows.

Consumer and business confidence often reflect macroeconomic realities; for example, confidence is usually

high when the economy is growing briskly and low during a recession. However, economic confidence can

sometimes rise or fall for reasons that do not have a close connection to the immediate economy, like a risk of

war, election results, foreign policy events, or a pessimistic prediction about the future by a prominent public

figure. U.S. presidents, for example, must be careful in their public pronouncements about the economy. If they

offer economic pessimism, they risk provoking a decline in confidence that reduces consumption and

investment and shifts AD to the left, and in a self-fulfilling prophecy, contributes to causing the recession that

284 11 • The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model

the president warned against in the first place. Figure 11.8 (b) shows a shift of AD to the left, and the
corresponding movement of the equilibrium, from E0 to E1, to a lower quantity of output and a lower price
level.

FIGURE 11.8 Shifts in Aggregate Demand (a) An increase in consumer confidence or business confidence can shift
AD to the right, from AD0 to AD1. When AD shifts to the right, the new equilibrium (E1) will have a higher quantity of
output and also a higher price level compared with the original equilibrium (E0). In this example, the new
equilibrium (E1) is also closer to potential GDP. An increase in government spending or a cut in taxes that leads to a
rise in consumer spending can also shift AD to the right. (b) A decrease in consumer confidence or business
confidence can shift AD to the left, from AD0 to AD1. When AD shifts to the left, the new equilibrium (E1) will have a
lower quantity of output and also a lower price level compared with the original equilibrium (E0). In this example,
the new equilibrium (E1) is also farther below potential GDP. A decrease in government spending or higher taxes that
leads to a fall in consumer spending can also shift AD to the left.

How Government Macroeconomic Policy Choices Can Shift AD

Government spending is one component of AD. Thus, higher government spending will cause AD to shift to the

right, as in Figure 11.8 (a), while lower government spending will cause AD to shift to the left, as in Figure 11.8

(b). For example, in the United States, government spending declined by 3.2% of GDP during the 1990s, from

21% of GDP in 1991, and to 17.8% of GDP in 1998. However, from 2005 to 2009, the peak of the Great

Recession, government spending increased from 19% of GDP to 21.4% of GDP. If changes of a few percentage

points of GDP seem small to you, remember that since GDP was about $14.4 trillion in 2009, a seemingly small

change of 2% of GDP is equal to close to $300 billion. Since 2009, government expenditures have gone back

down to around 17–18% of GDP, although in 2020 they rose to 18.5%.

11.4 • Shifts in Aggregate Demand 285

Tax policy can affect consumption and investment spending, too. Tax cuts for individuals will tend to increase

consumption demand, while tax increases will tend to diminish it. Tax policy can also pump up investment

demand by offering lower tax rates for corporations or tax reductions that benefit specific kinds of investment.

Shifting C or I will shift the AD curve as a whole.

During a recession, when unemployment is high and many businesses are suffering low profits or even losses,

the U.S. Congress often passes tax cuts. During the 2001 recession, for example, the U.S. Congress enacted a

tax cut into law. At such times, the political rhetoric often focuses on how people experiencing hard times need

relief from taxes. The aggregate supply and aggregate demand framework, however, offers a complementary
rationale, as Figure 11.9 illustrates. The original equilibrium during a recession is at point E0, relatively far
from the full employment level of output. The tax cut, by increasing consumption, shifts the AD curve to the
right. At the new equilibrium (E1), real GDP rises and unemployment falls and, because in this diagram the
economy has not yet reached its potential or full employment level of GDP, any rise in the price level remains

muted. Read the following Clear It Up feature to consider the question of whether economists favor tax cuts or

oppose them.

FIGURE 11.9 Recession and Full Employment in the AD/AS Model Whether the economy is in a recession is

illustrated in the AD/AS model by how close the equilibrium is to the potential GDP line as indicated by the vertical
LRAS line. In this example, the level of output Y0 at the equilibrium E0 is relatively far from the potential GDP line, so
it can represent an economy in recession, well below the full employment level of GDP. In contrast, the level of
output Y1 at the equilibrium E1 is relatively close to potential GDP, and so it would represent an economy with a
lower unemployment rate.

CLEAR IT UP

Do economists favor tax cuts or oppose them?
One of the most fundamental divisions in American politics over the last few decades has been between those who

believe that the government should cut taxes substantially and those who disagree. Ronald Reagan rode into the

presidency in 1980 partly because of his promise, soon carried out, to enact a substantial tax cut. George Bush lost

his bid for reelection against Bill Clinton in 1992 partly because he had broken his 1988 promise: “Read my lips! No

new taxes!” In the 2000 presidential election, both George W. Bush and Al Gore advocated substantial tax cuts and

Bush succeeded in pushing a tax cut package through Congress early in 2001. More recently in 2017 and 2018,

Donald Trump initiated a new round of tax cuts throughout the economy, and President Biden promised his own set

286 11 • The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model

of tax cuts in his 2021 spending bills.

What side do economists take? Do they support broad tax cuts or oppose them? The answer, unsatisfying to zealots

on both sides, is that it depends. One issue is whether equally large government spending cuts accompany the tax

cuts. Economists differ, as does any broad cross-section of the public, on how large government spending should be

and what programs the government might cut back. A second issue, more relevant to the discussion in this chapter,

concerns how close the economy is to the full employment output level. In a recession, when the AD and AS curves

intersect far below the full employment level, tax cuts can make sense as a way of shifting AD to the right. However,

when the economy is already performing extremely well, tax cuts may shift AD so far to the right as to generate

inflationary pressures, with little gain to GDP.

With the AD/AS framework in mind, many economists might readily believe that the 1981 Reagan tax cuts, which

took effect just after two serious recessions, were beneficial economic policy. Similarly, Congress enacted the 2001

Bush tax cuts and the 2009 Obama tax cuts during recessions. However, some of the same economists who favor

tax cuts during recession would be much more dubious about identical tax cuts at a time the economy is performing

well and cyclical unemployment is low.

Government spending and tax rate changes can be useful tools to affect aggregate demand. We will discuss

these in greater detail in the Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy chapter and The Impacts of Government

Borrowing. Other policy tools can shift the aggregate demand curve as well. For example, as we will discuss in

the Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation chapter, the Federal Reserve can affect interest rates and credit

availability. Higher interest rates tend to discourage borrowing and thus reduce both household spending on

big-ticket items like houses and cars and investment spending by business. Conversely, lower interest rates

will stimulate consumption and investment demand. Interest rates can also affect exchange rates, which in

turn will have effects on the export and import components of aggregate demand.

Clarifying the details of these alternative policies and how they affect the components of aggregate demand

can wait for The Keynesian Perspective chapter. Here, the key lesson is that a shift of the aggregate demand

curve to the right leads to a greater real GDP and to upward pressure on the price level. Conversely, a shift of

aggregate demand to the left leads to a lower real GDP and a lower price level. Whether these changes in output

and price level are relatively large or relatively small, and how the change in equilibrium relates to potential

GDP, depends on whether the shift in the AD curve is happening in the AS curve's relatively flat or relatively

steep portion.

11.5 How the AD/AS Model Incorporates Growth, Unemployment, and Inflation

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Use the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model to show periods of economic growth and recession

• Explain how unemployment and inflation impact the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model

• Evaluate the importance of the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model

The AD/AS model can convey a number of interlocking relationships between the three macroeconomic goals

of growth, unemployment, and low inflation. Moreover, the AD/AS framework is flexible enough to

accommodate both the Keynes’ law approach that focuses on aggregate demand and the short run, while also

including the Say’s law approach that focuses on aggregate supply and the long run. These advantages are

considerable. Every model is a simplified version of the deeper reality and, in the context of the AD/AS model,

the three macroeconomic goals arise in ways that are sometimes indirect or incomplete. In this module, we

consider how the AD/AS model illustrates the three macroeconomic goals of economic growth, low

unemployment, and low inflation.

11.5 • How the AD/AS Model Incorporates Growth, Unemployment, and Inflation 287

Growth and Recession in the AD/AS Diagram

In the AD/AS diagram, long-run economic growth due to productivity increases over time will be represented

by a gradual shift to the right of aggregate supply. The vertical line representing potential GDP (or the “full

employment level of GDP”) will gradually shift to the right over time as well. Earlier Figure 11.7 (a) showed a

pattern of economic growth over three years, with the AS curve shifting slightly out to the right each year.

However, the factors that determine the speed of this long-term economic growth rate—like investment in

physical and human capital, technology, and whether an economy can take advantage of catch-up growth—do

not appear directly in the AD/AS diagram.

In the short run, GDP falls and rises in every economy, as the economy dips into recession or expands out of

recession. The AD/AS diagram illustrates recessions when the equilibrium level of real GDP is substantially
below potential GDP, as we see at the equilibrium point E0 in Figure 11.9. From another standpoint, in years of
resurgent economic growth the equilibrium will typically be close to potential GDP, as equilibrium point E1 in
that earlier figure shows.

Unemployment in the AD/AS Diagram

We described two types of unemployment in the Unemployment chapter. Short run variations in
unemployment (cyclical unemployment) are caused by the business cycle as the economy expands and

contracts. Over the long run, in the United States, the unemployment rate typically hovers around 5% (give or

take one percentage point or so), when the economy is healthy. In many of the national economies across

Europe, the unemployment rate in recent decades has only dropped to about 10% or a bit lower, even in good

economic years. We call this baseline level of unemployment that occurs year-in and year-out the natural rate

of unemployment and we determine it by how well the structures of market and government institutions in the

economy lead to a matching of workers and employers in the labor market. Potential GDP can imply different

unemployment rates in different economies, depending on the natural rate of unemployment for that

economy.

The AD/AS diagram shows cyclical unemployment by how close the economy is to the potential or full GDP

employment level. Returning to Figure 11.9, relatively low cyclical unemployment for an economy occurs
when the level of output is close to potential GDP, as in the equilibrium point E1. Conversely, high cyclical
unemployment arises when the output is substantially to the left of potential GDP on the AD/AS diagram, as at
the equilibrium point E0. Although we do not show the factors that determine the natural rate of
unemployment separately in the AD/AS model, they are implicitly part of what determines potential GDP or

full employment GDP in a given economy.

Inflationary Pressures in the AD/AS Diagram

Inflation fluctuates in the short run. Higher inflation rates have typically occurred either during or just after

economic booms: for example, the biggest spurts of inflation in the U.S. economy during the twentieth century

followed the wartime booms of World War I and World War II. Conversely, rates of inflation generally decline

during recessions. As an extreme example, inflation actually became negative—a situation called

“deflation”—during the Great Depression. Even during the relatively short 1991-1992 recession, the inflation

rate declined from 5.4% in 1990 to 3.0% in 1992. During the relatively short 2001 recession, the rate of

inflation declined from 3.4% in 2000 to 1.6% in 2002. During the deep recession of 2007–2009, the inflation

rate declined from 3.8% in 2008 to –0.4% in 2009. Some countries have experienced bouts of high inflation

that lasted for years. In the U.S. economy since the mid–1980s, inflation does not seem to have had any long-

term trend to be substantially higher. Instead, it has stayed in the 1–5% range annually.

The AD/AS framework implies two ways that inflationary pressures may arise. One possible trigger is if

aggregate demand continues to shift to the right when the economy is already at or near potential GDP and full

employment, thus pushing the macroeconomic equilibrium into the AS curve's steep portion. In Figure 11.10
(a), there is a shift of aggregate demand to the right. The new equilibrium E1 is clearly at a higher price level

288 11 • The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model

than the original equilibrium E0. In this situation, the aggregate demand in the economy has soared so high
that firms in the economy are not capable of producing additional goods, because labor and physical capital

are fully employed, and so additional increases in aggregate demand can only result in a rise in the price level.

FIGURE 11.10 Sources of Inflationary Pressure in the AD/AS Model (a) A shift in aggregate demand, from AD0 to
AD1, when it happens in the area of the SRAS curve that is near potential GDP, will lead to a higher price level and to
pressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new equilibrium (E1) is at a higher price level (P1) than the
original equilibrium. (b) A shift in aggregate supply, from SRAS0 to SRAS1, will lead to a lower real GDP and to
pressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new equilibrium (E1) is at a higher price level (P1), while the
original equilibrium (E0) is at the lower price level (P0).

An alternative source of inflationary pressures can occur due to a rise in input prices that affects many or most

firms across the economy—perhaps an important input to production like oil or labor—and causes the

aggregate supply curve to shift back to the left. In Figure 11.10 (b), the SRAS curve's shift to the left also
increases the price level from P0 at the original equilibrium (E0) to a higher price level of P1 at the new
equilibrium (E1). In effect, the rise in input prices ends up, after the final output is produced and sold, passing
along in the form of a higher price level for outputs.

The AD/AS diagram shows only a one-time shift in the price level. It does not address the question of what

would cause inflation either to vanish after a year, or to sustain itself for several years. There are two

explanations for why inflation may persist over time. One way that continual inflationary price increases can

occur is if the government continually attempts to stimulate aggregate demand in a way that keeps pushing the

AD curve when it is already in the SRAS curve's steep portion. A second possibility is that, if inflation has been

occurring for several years, people might begin to expect a certain level of inflation. If they do, then these

expectations will cause prices, wages and interest rates to increase annually by the amount of the inflation

expected. These two reasons are interrelated, because if a government fosters a macroeconomic environment

with inflationary pressures, then people will grow to expect inflation. However, the AD/AS diagram does not

show these patterns of ongoing or expected inflation in a direct way.

Importance of the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model

Macroeconomics takes an overall view of the economy, which means that it needs to juggle many different

concepts. For example, start with the three macroeconomic goals of growth, low inflation, and low

11.6 • Keynes’ Law and Say’s Law in the AD/AS Model 289

unemployment. Aggregate demand has four elements: consumption, investment, government spending, and

exports less imports. Aggregate supply reveals how businesses throughout the economy will react to a higher

price level for outputs. Finally, a wide array of economic events and policy decisions can affect aggregate

demand and aggregate supply, including government tax and spending decisions; consumer and business

confidence; changes in prices of key inputs like oil; and technology that brings higher levels of productivity.

The aggregate demand/aggregate supply model is one of the fundamental diagrams in this course (like the

budget constraint diagram that we introduced in the Choice in a World of Scarcity chapter and the supply and

demand diagram in the Demand and Supply chapter) because it provides an overall framework for bringing

these factors together in one diagram. Some version of the AD/AS model will appear in every chapter in the

rest of this book.

• Use an aggregate demand/aggregate supply model as a diagnostic test to understand the current state of

the economy

We can use the AD/AS model to illustrate both Say’s law that supply creates its own demand and Keynes’ law

that demand creates its own supply. Consider the SRAS curve's three zones which Figure 11.11 identifies: the

Keynesian zone, the neoclassical zone, and the intermediate zone.

FIGURE 11.11 Keynes, Neoclassical, and Intermediate Zones in the Aggregate Supply Curve Near the equilibrium

Ek, in the Keynesian zone at the far left of the SRAS curve, small shifts in AD, either to the right or the left, will affect

the output level Yk, but will not much affect the price level. In the Keynesian zone, AD largely determines the

quantity of output. Near the equilibrium En, in the neoclassical zone at the SRAS curve's far right, small shifts in AD,

either to the right or the left, will have relatively little effect on the output level Yn, but instead will have a greater
effect on the price level. In the neoclassical zone, the near-vertical SRAS curve close to the level of potential GDP

largely determines the quantity of output. In the intermediate zone around equilibrium Ei, movement in AD to the

right will increase both the output level and the price level, while a movement in AD to the left would decrease both

the output level and the price level.

290 11 • The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model

Focus first on the Keynesian zone, that portion of the SRAS curve on the far left which is relatively flat. If the

AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like Ek, then certain statements about

the economic situation will follow. In the Keynesian zone, the equilibrium level of real GDP is far below

potential GDP, the economy is in recession, and cyclical unemployment is high. If aggregate demand shifted to

the right or left in the Keynesian zone, it will determine the resulting level of output (and thus unemployment).

However, inflationary price pressure is not much of a worry in the Keynesian zone, since the price level does

not vary much in this zone.

Now, focus your attention on the neoclassical zone of the SRAS curve, which is the near-vertical portion on the

right-hand side. If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like En where

output is at or near potential GDP, then the size of potential GDP pretty much determines the level of output in

the economy. Since the equilibrium is near potential GDP, cyclical unemployment is low in this economy,

although structural unemployment may remain an issue. In the neoclassical zone, shifts of aggregate demand

to the right or the left have little effect on the level of output or employment. The only way to increase the size

of the real GDP in the neoclassical zone is for AS to shift to the right. However, shifts in AD in the neoclassical

zone will create pressures to change the price level.

Finally, consider the SRAS curve's intermediate zone in Figure 11.11. If the AD curve crosses this portion of
the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like Ei, then we might expect unemployment and inflation to move in

opposing directions. For instance, a shift of AD to the right will move output closer to potential GDP and thus

reduce unemployment, but will also lead to a higher price level and upward pressure on inflation. Conversely, a

shift of AD to the left will move output further from potential GDP and raise unemployment, but will also lead

to a lower price level and downward pressure on inflation.

This approach of dividing the SRAS curve into different zones works as a diagnostic test that we can apply to

an economy, like a doctor checking a patient for symptoms. First, figure out in what zone the economy is. This

will clarify the economic issues, tradeoffs, and policy choices. Some economists believe that the economy is

strongly predisposed to be in one zone or another. Thus, hard-line Keynesian economists believe that the

economies are in the Keynesian zone most of the time, and so they view the neoclassical zone as a theoretical

abstraction. Conversely, hard-line neoclassical economists argue that economies are in the neoclassical zone

most of the time and that the Keynesian zone is a distraction. The Keynesian Perspective and The Neoclassical

Perspective should help to clarify the underpinnings and consequences of these contrasting views of the

macroeconomy.

The Pandemic-Induced Recession: Supply or Demand?
We mentioned earlier that a pandemic could cause a shock in the short- or long-run aggregate supply curve by

temporarily reducing labor supply and slowing or stopping production of goods and services. Pandemics can also

affect aggregate demand. When people are hesitant to spend or travel, or if they are not allowed to spend or travel

because of social restrictions, this will affect spending in the economy. Consumers spend less at restaurants, hotels,

and travel, among other areas, while firms stop investing because of the lack of demand and an uncertain future.

Both actions lead to a leftward shift in the aggregate demand curve.

While there is some debate over whether the pandemic-induced recession that the U.S. economy experienced in

2020 was primarily a supply- or demand-driven one, most likely, it is a combination of both. In March and April

2020, workers left the labor market en masse, and later in the year, they were hesitant to return due to health and

safety concerns. Many people were also forced to cancel travel plans or voluntarily did so out of concern for their

safety, further reducing aggregate demand. These changes caused deep cuts in the global economy that continued

to be felt two years after the initial pandemic-induced shocks.

Key Concepts and Summary

11.1 Macroeconomic Perspectives on Demand and Supply

Neoclassical economists emphasize Say’s law, which holds that supply creates its own demand. Keynesian

economists emphasize Keynes’ law, which holds that demand creates its own supply. Many mainstream

economists take a Keynesian perspective, emphasizing the importance of aggregate demand, for the short run,

and a neoclassical perspective, emphasizing the importance of aggregate supply, for the long run.

11.2 Building a Model of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply

The upward-sloping short run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve shows the positive relationship between the

price level and the level of real GDP in the short run. Aggregate supply slopes up because when the price level

for outputs increases, while the price level of inputs remains fixed, the opportunity for additional profits

encourages more production. The aggregate supply curve is near-horizontal on the left and near-vertical on

the right. In the long run, we show the aggregate supply by a vertical line at the level of potential output, which

is the maximum level of output the economy can produce with its existing levels of workers, physical capital,

technology, and economic institutions.

The downward-sloping aggregate demand (AD) curve shows the relationship between the price level for

outputs and the quantity of total spending in the economy. It slopes down because of: (a) the wealth effect,

which means that a higher price level leads to lower real wealth, which reduces the level of consumption; (b)

the interest rate effect, which holds that a higher price level will mean a greater demand for money, which will

tend to drive up interest rates and reduce investment spending; and (c) the foreign price effect, which holds

that a rise in the price level will make domestic goods relatively more expensive, discouraging exports and

292 11 • Key Concepts and Summary

encouraging imports.

11.3 Shifts in Aggregate Supply

The aggregate demand/aggregate supply (AD/AS) diagram shows how AD and AS interact. The intersection of

the AD and AS curves shows the equilibrium output and price level in the economy. Movements of either AS or

AD will result in a different equilibrium output and price level. The aggregate supply curve will shift out to the

right as productivity increases. It will shift back to the left as the price of key inputs rises, and will shift out to

the right if the price of key inputs falls. If the AS curve shifts back to the left, the combination of lower output,

higher unemployment, and higher inflation, called stagflation, occurs. If AS shifts out to the right, a

combination of lower inflation, higher output, and lower unemployment is possible.

11.4 Shifts in Aggregate Demand

The AD curve will shift out as the components of aggregate demand—C, I, G, and X–M—rise. It will shift back to

the left as these components fall. These factors can change because of different personal choices, like those

resulting from consumer or business confidence, or from policy choices like changes in government spending

and taxes. If the AD curve shifts to the right, then the equilibrium quantity of output and the price level will

rise. If the AD curve shifts to the left, then the equilibrium quantity of output and the price level will fall.
Whether equilibrium output changes relatively more than the price level or whether the price level changes

relatively more than output is determined by where the AD curve intersects with the AS curve.

The AD/AS diagram superficially resembles the microeconomic supply and demand diagram on the surface,

but in reality, what is on the horizontal and vertical axes and the underlying economic reasons for the shapes

of the curves are very different. We can illustrate long-term economic growth in the AD/AS framework by a

gradual shift of the aggregate supply curve to the right. We illustrate a recession when the intersection of AD

and AS is substantially below potential GDP, while we illustrate an expanding economy when the intersection

of AS and AD is near potential GDP.

11.5 How the AD/AS Model Incorporates Growth, Unemployment, and Inflation

Cyclical unemployment is relatively large in the AD/AS framework when the equilibrium is substantially below

potential GDP. Cyclical unemployment is small in the AD/AS framework when the equilibrium is near potential

GDP. The natural rate of unemployment, as determined by the labor market institutions of the economy, is

built into what economists mean by potential GDP, but does not otherwise appear in an AD/AS diagram. The

AD/AS framework shows pressures for inflation to rise or fall when the movement from one equilibrium to

another causes the price level to rise or to fall. The balance of trade does not appear directly in the AD/AS

diagram, but it appears indirectly in several ways. Increases in exports or declines in imports can cause shifts

in AD. Changes in the price of key imported inputs to production, like oil, can cause shifts in AS. The AD/AS
model is the key model we use in this book to understand macroeconomic issues.

11.6 Keynes’ Law and Say’s Law in the AD/AS Model

We can divide the SRAS curve into three zones. Keynes’ law says demand creates its own supply, so that

changes in aggregate demand cause changes in real GDP and employment. We can show Keynes’ law on the

horizontal Keynesian zone of the aggregate supply curve. The Keynesian zone occurs at the left of the SRAS

curve where it is fairly flat, so movements in AD will affect output, but have little effect on the price level. Say’s

law says supply creates its own demand. Changes in aggregate demand have no effect on real GDP and

employment, only on the price level. We can show Say’s law on the vertical neoclassical zone of the aggregate

supply curve. The neoclassical zone occurs at the right of the SRAS curve where it is fairly vertical, and so

movements in AD will affect the price level, but have little impact on output. The intermediate zone in the

middle of the SRAS curve is upward-sloping, so a rise in AD will cause higher output and price level, while a fall

in AD will lead to a lower output and price level.

Introduction to the Keynesian Perspective

BRING IT HOME

The Great Recession
The 2008–2009 Great Recession hit the U.S. economy hard. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the

number of unemployed Americans rose from 6.8 million in May 2007 to 15.4 million in October 2009. During that

time, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that approximately 170,000 small businesses closed. Mass layoffs peaked

in February 2009 when employers gave 326,392 workers notice. U.S. productivity and output fell as well. Job

losses, declining home values, declining incomes, and uncertainty about the future caused consumption

expenditures to decrease. According to the BLS, household spending dropped by 7.8%.

Home foreclosures and the meltdown in U.S. financial markets called for immediate action by Congress, the

President, and the Federal Reserve Bank. For example, the government implemented programs such as the

American Restoration and Recovery Act to help millions of people by providing tax credits for homebuyers, paying

300 12 • The Keynesian Perspective

“cash for clunkers,” and extending unemployment benefits. From cutting back on spending, filing for

unemployment, and losing homes, millions of people were affected by the recession. While the United States is now

on the path to recovery, people will feel the impact for many years to come.

What caused this recession and what prevented the economy from spiraling further into another depression?

Policymakers looked to the lessons learned from the 1930s Great Depression and to John Maynard Keynes' models

to analyze the causes and find solutions to the country’s economic woes. The Keynesian perspective is the subject

of this chapter.

We have learned that the level of economic activity, for example output, employment, and spending, tends to

grow over time. In The Keynesian Perspective we learned the reasons for this trend. The Macroeconomic

Perspective pointed out that the economy tends to cycle around the long-run trend. In other words, the

economy does not always grow at its average growth rate. Sometimes economic activity grows at the trend rate,

sometimes it grows more than the trend, sometimes it grows less than the trend, and sometimes it actually

declines. You can see this cyclical behavior in Figure 12.2.

FIGURE 12.2 U.S. Real Domestic Product, Percent Changes 1930–2020 The chart tracks the percent change in

Real GDP since 1930. The magnitude of both recessions and peaks was quite large between 1930 and 1945.

(Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis, “National Economic Accounts,” https://apps.bea.gov/itable/index.cfm)

This empirical reality raises two important questions: How can we explain the cycles, and to what extent can

we moderate them? This chapter (on the Keynesian perspective) and The Neoclassical Perspective explore

those questions from two different points of view, building on what we learned in The Aggregate Demand/

Aggregate Supply Model.

12.1 • Aggregate Demand in Keynesian Analysis 301

12.1 Aggregate Demand in Keynesian Analysis

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain real GDP, recessionary gaps, and inflationary gaps

• Recognize the Keynesian AD/AS model

•

Identify the determining factors of both consumption expenditure and investment expenditure

• Analyze the factors that determine government spending and net exports

The Keynesian perspective focuses on aggregate demand. The idea is simple: firms produce output only if they

expect it to sell. Thus, while the availability of the factors of production determines a nation’s potential GDP,

the amount of goods and services that actually sell, known as real GDP, depends on how much demand exists

across the economy. Figure 12.3 illustrates this point.

FIGURE 12.3 The Keynesian AD/AS Model The Keynesian View of the AD/AS Model uses an SRAS curve, which is

horizontal at levels of output below potential and vertical at potential output. Thus, when beginning from potential

output, any decrease in AD affects only output, but not prices. Any increase in AD affects only prices, not output.

Keynes argued that, for reasons we explain shortly, aggregate demand is not stable—that it can change
unexpectedly. Suppose the economy starts where AD intersects SRAS at P0 and Yp. Because Yp is potential
output, the economy is at full employment. Because AD is volatile, it can easily fall. Thus, even if we start at Yp,

if AD falls, then we find ourselves in what Keynes termed a recessionary gap. The economy is in equilibrium
but with less than full employment, as Y1 in Figure 12.3 shows. Keynes believed that the economy would tend
to stay in a recessionary gap, with its attendant unemployment, for a significant period of time.

In the same way (although we do not show it in the figure), if AD increases, the economy could experience an

inflationary gap, where demand is attempting to push the economy past potential output. Consequently, the
economy experiences inflation. The key policy implication for either situation is that government needs to step

in and close the gap, increasing spending during recessions and decreasing spending during booms to return

aggregate demand to match potential output.

Recall from The Aggregate Supply-Aggregate Demand Model that aggregate demand is total spending,

economy-wide, on domestic goods and services. (Aggregate demand (AD) is actually what economists call total

planned expenditure. Read the appendix on The Expenditure-Output Model for more on this.) You may also

remember that aggregate demand is the sum of four components: consumption expenditure, investment

expenditure, government spending, and spending on net exports (exports minus imports). In the following

sections, we will examine each component through the Keynesian perspective.

What Determines Consumption Expenditure?

Consumption expenditure is spending by households and individuals on durable goods, nondurable goods,

and services. Durable goods are items that last and provide value over time, such as automobiles. Nondurable

goods are things like groceries—once you consume them, they are gone. Recall from The Macroeconomic

302 12 • The Keynesian Perspective

Perspective that services are intangible things consumers buy, like healthcare or entertainment.

Keynes identified three factors that affect consumption:

• Disposable income: For most people, the single most powerful determinant of how much they consume is

how much income they have in their take-home pay, also known as disposable income, which is income

after taxes.

• Expected future income: Consumer expectations about future income also are important in determining

consumption. If consumers feel optimistic about the future, they are more likely to spend and increase

overall aggregate demand. News of recession and troubles in the economy will make them pull back on

consumption.

• Wealth or credit: When households experience a rise in wealth, they may be willing to consume a higher

share of their income and to save less. When the U.S. stock market rose dramatically in the late 1990s, for

example, U.S. savings rates declined, probably in part because people felt that their wealth had increased

and there was less need to save. How do people spend beyond their income, when they perceive their

wealth increasing? The answer is borrowing. On the other side, when the U.S. stock market declined about

40% from March 2008 to March 2009, people felt far greater uncertainty about their economic future, so
savings rates increased while consumption declined.

Finally, Keynes noted that a variety of other factors combine to determine how much people save and spend. If

household preferences about saving shift in a way that encourages consumption rather than saving, then AD

will shift out to the right.

various groups of people.

What Determines Investment Expenditure?

We call spending on new capital goods investment expenditure. Investment falls into four categories:

producer’s durable equipment and software, nonresidential structures (such as factories, offices, and retail

locations), changes in inventories, and residential structures (such as single-family homes, townhouses, and

apartment buildings). Businesses conduct the first three types of investment, while households conduct the

last.

Keynes’s treatment of investment focuses on the key role of expectations about the future in influencing

business decisions. When a business decides to make an investment in physical assets, like plants or
equipment, or in intangible assets, like skills or a research and development project, that firm considers both

the expected investment benefits (future profit expectations) and the investment costs (interest rates).

• Expectations of future profits: The clearest driver of investment benefits is expectations for future profits.

When we expect an economy to grow, businesses perceive a growing market for their products. Their

higher degree of business confidence will encourage new investment. For example, in the second half of

the 1990s, U.S. investment levels surged from 18% of GDP in 1994 to 21% in 2000. However, when a

recession started in 2001, U.S. investment levels quickly sank back to 18% of GDP by 2002.

•

Interest rates also play a significant role in determining how much investment a firm will make. Just as

individuals need to borrow money to purchase homes, so businesses need financing when they purchase

big ticket items. The cost of investment thus includes the interest rate. Even if the firm has the funds, the

interest rate measures the opportunity cost of purchasing business capital. Lower interest rates stimulate

investment spending and higher interest rates reduce it.

Many factors can affect the expected profitability on investment. For example, if the energy prices decline,

then investments that use energy as an input will yield higher profits. If government offers special incentives

12.1 • Aggregate Demand in Keynesian Analysis 303

for investment (for example, through the tax code), then investment will look more attractive; conversely, if

government removes special investment incentives from the tax code, or increases other business taxes, then

investment will look less attractive. As Keynes noted, business investment is the most variable of all the

components of aggregate demand.

What Determines Government Spending?

The third component of aggregate demand is federal, state, and local government spending. Although we

usually view the United States as a market economy, government still plays a significant role in the economy.

As we discuss in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities (http://openstax.org/books/principles-

economics-3e/pages/12-introduction-to-environmental-protection-and-negative-externalities) and Positive

Externalities and Public Goods (http://openstax.org/books/principles-economics-3e/pages/13-introduction-to-

positive-externalities-and-public-goods), government provides important public services such as national

defense, transportation infrastructure, and education.

Keynes recognized that the government budget offered a powerful tool for influencing aggregate demand. Not

only could more government spending stimulate AD (or less government spending reduce it), but lowering or

raising tax rates could influence consumption and investment spending. Keynes concluded that during

extreme times like deep recessions, only the government had the power and resources to move aggregate

demand. For example, during the 2020 pandemic-induced recession, the federal government gave money to

state and local governments and to households to support the economy when many firms and governments

needed to shut down or suffered a large decline in revenue and needed to lay off workers.

What Determines Net Exports?

Recall that exports are domestically produced products that sell abroad while imports are foreign produced

products that consumers purchase domestically. Since we define aggregate demand as spending on domestic

goods and services, export expenditures add to AD, while import expenditures subtract from AD.

Two sets of factors can cause shifts in export and import demand: changes in relative growth rates between

countries and changes in relative prices between countries. What is happening in the countries' economies

that would be purchasing those exports heavily affects the level of demand for a nation's exports. For example,

if major importers of American-made products like Canada, Japan, and Germany have recessions, exports of

U.S. products to those countries are likely to decline. Conversely, the amount of income in the domestic

economy directly affects the quantity of a nation's imports: more income will bring a higher level of imports.

Relative prices of goods in domestic and international markets can also affect exports and imports. If U.S.

goods are relatively cheaper compared with goods made in other places, perhaps because a group of U.S.

producers has mastered certain productivity breakthroughs, then U.S. exports are likely to rise. If U.S. goods
become relatively more expensive, perhaps because a change in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and

other currencies has pushed up the price of inputs to production in the United States, then exports from U.S.

producers are likely to decline.

Table 12.1 summarizes the reasons we have explained for changes in aggregate demand.

12.2 The Building Blocks of Keynesian Analysis

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Evaluate the Keynesian view of recessions through an understanding of sticky wages and prices and the

importance of aggregate demand

• Explain the coordination argument, menu costs, and macroeconomic externality

• Analyze the impact of the expenditure multiplier

Now that we have a clear understanding of what constitutes aggregate demand, we return to the Keynesian

argument using the model of aggregate demand/aggregate supply (AD/AS). (For a similar treatment using

Keynes’ income-expenditure model, see the appendix on The Expenditure-Output Model.)

Keynesian economics focuses on explaining why recessions and depressions occur and offering a policy

prescription for minimizing their effects. The Keynesian view of recession is based on two key building blocks.

First, aggregate demand is not always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire

enough workers to reach full employment. Second, the macroeconomy may adjust only slowly to shifts in

aggregate demand because of sticky wages and prices, which are wages and prices that do not respond to

decreases or increases in demand. We will consider these two claims in turn, and then see how they are

represented in the AD/AS model.

The first building block of the Keynesian diagnosis is that recessions occur when the level of demand for goods

and services is less than what is produced when labor is fully employed. In other words, the intersection of

aggregate supply and aggregate demand occurs at a level of output less than the level of GDP consistent with

full employment. Suppose the stock market crashes, as in 1929, or suppose the housing market collapses, as in

2008. In either case, household wealth will decline, and consumption expenditure will follow. Suppose

12.2 • The Building Blocks of Keynesian Analysis 305

businesses see that consumer spending is falling or face restrictions from a pandemic that curtail their

operations. That will reduce expectations of the profitability of investment, so businesses will decrease

investment expenditure.

This seemed to be the case during the Great Depression, since the physical capacity of the economy to supply

goods did not alter much. No flood or earthquake or other natural disaster ruined factories in 1929 or 1930. No

outbreak of disease decimated the ranks of workers. No key input price, like the price of oil, soared on world

markets. The U.S. economy in 1933 had just about the same factories, workers, and state of technology as it

had had four years earlier in 1929—and yet the economy had shrunk dramatically. This also seems to be what

happened in 2008.

As Keynes recognized, the events of the Depression contradicted Say’s law that “supply creates its own

demand.” Although production capacity existed, the markets were not able to sell their products. As a result,

real GDP was less than potential GDP.

Wage and Price Stickiness

Keynes also pointed out that although AD fluctuated, prices and wages did not immediately respond as

economists often expected. Instead, prices and wages are “sticky,” making it difficult to restore the economy to

full employment and potential GDP. Keynes emphasized one particular reason why wages were sticky: the

coordination argument. This argument points out that, even if most people would be willing—at least

hypothetically—to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also

experienced such a decline, a market-oriented economy has no obvious way to implement a plan of

coordinated wage reductions. Unemployment proposed a number of reasons why wages might be sticky

downward, most of which center on the argument that businesses avoid wage cuts because they may in one

way or another depress morale and hurt the productivity of the existing workers.

Some modern economists have argued in a Keynesian spirit that, along with wages, other prices may be sticky,

too. Many firms do not change their prices every day or even every month. When a firm considers changing

prices, it must consider two sets of costs. First, changing prices uses company resources: managers must

analyze the competition and market demand and decide the new prices, they must update sales materials,

change billing records, and redo product and price labels. Second, frequent price changes may leave

customers confused or angry—especially if they discover that a product now costs more than they expected.

These costs of changing prices are called menu costs—like the costs of printing a new set of menus with
different prices in a restaurant. Prices do respond to forces of supply and demand, but from a macroeconomic

perspective, the process of changing all prices throughout the economy takes time.

To understand the effect of sticky wages and prices in the economy, consider Figure 12.4 (a) illustrating the

overall labor market, while Figure 12.4 (b) illustrates a market for a specific good or service. The original
equilibrium (E0) in each market occurs at the intersection of the demand curve (D0) and supply curve (S0).
When aggregate demand declines, the demand for labor shifts to the left (to D1) in Figure 12.4 (a) and the
demand for goods shifts to the left (to D1) in Figure 12.4 (b). However, because of sticky wages and prices, the
wage remains at its original level (W0) for a period of time and the price remains at its original level (P0).

As a result, a situation of excess supply—where the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded at the
existing wage or price—exists in markets for both labor and goods, and Q1 is less than Q0 in both Figure 12.4 (a)
and Figure 12.4 (b). When many labor markets and many goods markets all across the economy find

themselves in this position, the economy is in a recession; that is, firms cannot sell what they wish to produce

at the existing market price and do not wish to hire all who are willing to work at the existing market wage. The

306 12 • The Keynesian Perspective

Clear It Up feature discusses this problem in more detail.

FIGURE 12.4 Sticky Prices and Falling Demand in the Labor and Goods Market In both (a) and (b), demand shifts
left from D0 to D1. However, the wage in (a) and the price in (b) do not immediately decline. In (a), the quantity
demanded of labor at the original wage (W0) is Q0, but with the new demand curve for labor (D1), it will be Q1.
Similarly, in (b), the quantity demanded of goods at the original price (P0) is Q0, but at the new demand curve (D1) it
will be Q1. An excess supply of labor will exist, which we call unemployment. An excess supply of goods will also
exist, where the quantity demanded is substantially less than the quantity supplied. Thus, sticky wages and sticky

prices, combined with a drop in demand, bring about unemployment and recession.

CLEAR IT UP

Why Was the Pace of Wage Adjustments Slow?
The recovery after the Great Recession in the United States was slow. In fact, many low-wage workers at

McDonalds, Dominos, and Walmart threatened to strike for higher wages. Their plight was part of a larger trend in

job growth and pay in the post–recession recovery.

FIGURE 12.5 Jobs Lost/Gained in the Recession/Recovery Data in the aftermath of the Great Recession suggests

that jobs lost were in mid-wage occupations, while jobs gained were in low-wage occupations.

Access for free at openstax.org

12.2 • The Building Blocks of Keynesian Analysis 307

The National Employment Law Project compiled data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found that, during the

Great Recession, 60% of job losses were in medium-wage occupations. Most of them were replaced during the

recovery period with lower-wage jobs in the service, retail, and food industries. Figure 12.5 illustrates this data.

Wages in the service, retail, and food industries are at or near minimum wage and tend to be both downwardly and

upwardly “sticky.” Wages are downwardly sticky due to minimum wage laws. They may be upwardly sticky if

insufficient competition in low-skilled labor markets enables employers to avoid raising wages that would reduce

their profits. At the same time, however, the Consumer Price Index increased 11% between 2007 and 2012,

pushing real wages down.

The Two Keynesian Assumptions in the AD/AS Model

Figure 12.6 is the AD/AS diagram which illustrates these two Keynesian assumptions—the importance of

aggregate demand in causing recession and the stickiness of wages and prices. Note that because of the

stickiness of wages and prices, the aggregate supply curve is flatter than either supply curve (labor or specific

good). In fact, if wages and prices were so sticky that they did not fall at all, the aggregate supply curve would

be completely flat below potential GDP, as Figure 12.6 shows. This outcome is an important example of a

macroeconomic externality, where what happens at the macro level is different from and inferior to what

happens at the micro level. For example, a firm should respond to a decrease in demand for its product by

cutting its price to increase sales. However, if all firms experience a decrease in demand for their products,

sticky prices in the aggregate prevent aggregate demand from rebounding (which we would show as a

movement along the AD curve in response to a lower price level).

The original equilibrium of this economy occurs where the aggregate demand function (AD0) intersects with
AS. Since this intersection occurs at potential GDP (Yp), the economy is operating at full employment. When

aggregate demand shifts to the left, all the adjustment occurs through decreased real GDP. There is no
decrease in the price level. Since the equilibrium occurs at Y1, the economy experiences substantial
unemployment.

FIGURE 12.6 A Keynesian Perspective of Recession This figure illustrates the two key assumptions behind
Keynesian economics. A recession begins when aggregate demand declines from AD0 to AD1. The recession persists
because of the assumption of fixed wages and prices, which makes the SRAS flat below potential GDP. If that were
not the case, the price level would fall also, raising GDP and limiting the recession. Instead the intersection E1
occurs in the flat portion of the SRAS curve where GDP is less than potential.

The Expenditure Multiplier

A key concept in Keynesian economics is the expenditure multiplier. The expenditure multiplier is the idea

that not only does spending affect the equilibrium level of GDP, but that spending is powerful. More precisely, it

means that a change in spending causes a more than proportionate change in GDP.

308 12 • The Keynesian Perspective

The reason for the expenditure multiplier is that one person’s spending becomes another person’s income,

which leads to additional spending and additional income so that the cumulative impact on GDP is larger than

the initial increase in spending. The appendix on The Expenditure-Output Model provides the details of the

multiplier process, but the concept is important enough for us to summarize here. While the multiplier is

important for understanding the effectiveness of fiscal policy, it occurs whenever any autonomous increase in

spending occurs. Additionally, the multiplier operates in a negative as well as a positive direction. Thus, when

investment spending collapsed during the Great Depression, it caused a much larger decrease in real GDP. The

size of the multiplier is critical and was a key element in discussions of the effectiveness of the Obama

administration’s fiscal stimulus package, officially titled the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

12.3 The Phillips Curve

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain the Phillips curve, noting its impact on the theories of Keynesian economics

• Graph a Phillips curve

•

Identify factors that cause the instability of the Phillips curve

• Analyze the Keynesian policy for reducing unemployment and inflation

The simplified AD/AS model that we have used so far is fully consistent with Keynes’s original model. More

recent research, though, has indicated that in the real world, an aggregate supply curve is more curved than

the right angle that we used in this chapter. Rather, the real-world AS curve is very flat at levels of output far

below potential (“the Keynesian zone”), very steep at levels of output above potential (“the neoclassical zone”)

and curved in between (“the intermediate zone”). Figure 12.7 illustrates this. The typical aggregate supply

curve leads to the concept of the Phillips curve.

FIGURE 12.7 Keynes, Neoclassical, and Intermediate Zones in the Aggregate Supply Curve Near the equilibrium

Ek, in the Keynesian zone at the SRAS curve's far left, small shifts in AD, either to the right or the left, will affect the

output level Yk, but will not much affect the price level. In the Keynesian zone, AD largely determines the quantity of

output. Near the equilibrium En, in the neoclassical zone, at the SRAS curve's far right, small shifts in AD, either to

the right or the left, will have relatively little effect on the output level Yn, but instead will have a greater effect on

the price level. In the neoclassical zone, the near-vertical SRAS curve close to the level of potential GDP (as

12.3 • The Phillips Curve 309

represented by the LRAS line) largely determines the quantity of output. In the intermediate zone around

equilibrium Ei, movement in AD to the right will increase both the output level and the price level, while a movement

in AD to the left would decrease both the output level and the price level.

The Discovery of the Phillips Curve

In the 1950s, A.W. Phillips, an economist at the London School of Economics, was studying the Keynesian

analytical framework. The Keynesian theory implied that during a recession inflationary pressures are low, but

when the level of output is at or even pushing beyond potential GDP, the economy is at greater risk for inflation.

Phillips analyzed 60 years of British data and did find that tradeoff between unemployment and inflation,

which became known as the Phillips curve. Figure 12.8 shows a theoretical Phillips curve, and the following

Work It Out feature shows how the pattern appears for the United States.

FIGURE 12.8 A Keynesian Phillips Curve Tradeoff between Unemployment and Inflation A Phillips curve illustrates a

tradeoff between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate. If one is higher, the other must be lower. For

example, point A illustrates a 5% inflation rate and a 4% unemployment. If the government attempts to reduce

inflation to 2%, then it will experience a rise in unemployment to 7%, as point B shows.

break down during the 1970s as the Phillips Curve shifted out to the right.

Over this longer period of time, the Phillips curve appears to have shifted out. There is no tradeoff any more.

The Instability of the Phillips Curve

During the 1960s, economists viewed the Phillips curve as a policy menu. A nation could choose low inflation

and high unemployment, or high inflation and low unemployment, or anywhere in between. Economies could

use fiscal and monetary policy to move up or down the Phillips curve as desired. Then a curious thing

happened. When policymakers tried to exploit the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, the result

was an increase in both inflation and unemployment. What had happened? The Phillips curve shifted.

Access for free at openstax.org

12.3 • The Phillips Curve 311

The U.S. economy experienced this pattern in the deep recession from 1973 to 1975, and again in back-to-

back recessions from 1980 to 1982. Many nations around the world saw similar increases in unemployment

and inflation. This pattern became known as stagflation. (Recall from The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate

Supply Model that stagflation is an unhealthy combination of high unemployment and high inflation.) Perhaps

most important, stagflation was a phenomenon that traditional Keynesian economics could not explain.

Economists have concluded that two factors cause the Phillips curve to shift. The first is supply shocks, like the

mid-1970s oil crisis, which first brought stagflation into our vocabulary. The second is changes in people’s

expectations about inflation. In other words, there may be a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment

when people expect no inflation, but when they realize inflation is occurring, the tradeoff disappears. Both

factors (supply shocks and changes in inflationary expectations) cause the aggregate supply curve, and thus

the Phillips curve, to shift.

In short, we should interpret a downward-sloping Phillips curve as valid for short-run periods of several years,

but over longer periods, when aggregate supply shifts, the downward-sloping Phillips curve can shift so that

unemployment and inflation are both higher (as in the 1970s and early 1980s) or both lower (as in the early

1990s or first decade of the 2000s).

Keynesian Policy for Fighting Unemployment and Inflation

Keynesian macroeconomics argues that the solution to a recession is expansionary fiscal policy, such as tax

cuts to stimulate consumption and investment, or direct increases in government spending that would shift

the aggregate demand curve to the right. For example, if aggregate demand was originally at ADr in Figure

12.11, so that the economy was in recession, the appropriate policy would be for government to shift aggregate

demand to the right from ADr to ADf, where the economy would be at potential GDP and full employment.

Keynes noted that while it would be nice if the government could spend additional money on housing, roads,

and other amenities, he also argued that if the government could not agree on how to spend money in practical

ways, then it could spend in impractical ways. For example, Keynes suggested building monuments, like a

modern equivalent of the Egyptian pyramids. He proposed that the government could bury money

underground, and let mining companies start digging up the money again. These suggestions were slightly

tongue-in-cheek, but their purpose was to emphasize that a Great Depression is no time to quibble over the

specifics of government spending programs and tax cuts when the goal should be to pump up aggregate

demand by enough to lift the economy to potential GDP.

FIGURE 12.11 Fighting Recession and Inflation with Keynesian Policy If an economy is in recession, with an

equilibrium at Er, then the Keynesian response would be to enact a policy to shift aggregate demand to the right

from ADr toward ADf. If an economy is experiencing inflationary pressures with an equilibrium at Ei, then the

312 12 • The Keynesian Perspective

Keynesian response would be to enact a policy response to shift aggregate demand to the left, from ADi toward ADf.

The other side of Keynesian policy occurs when the economy is operating above potential GDP. In this

situation, unemployment is low, but inflationary rises in the price level are a concern. The Keynesian response

would be contractionary fiscal policy, using tax increases or government spending cuts to shift AD to the left.

The result would be downward pressure on the price level, but very little reduction in output or very little rise

in unemployment. If aggregate demand was originally at ADi in Figure 12.11, so that the economy was

experiencing inflationary rises in the price level, the appropriate policy would be for government to shift

aggregate demand to the left, from ADi toward ADf, which reduces the pressure for a higher price level while

the economy remains at full employment.

In the Keynesian economic model, too little aggregate demand brings unemployment and too much brings

inflation. Thus, you can think of Keynesian economics as pursuing a “Goldilocks” level of aggregate demand:

not too much, not too little, but looking for what is just right.

12.4 The Keynesian Perspective on Market Forces

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain the Keynesian perspective on market forces

• Analyze the role of government policy in economic management

Ever since the birth of Keynesian economics in the 1930s, controversy has simmered over the extent to which

government should play an active role in managing the economy. In the aftermath of the human devastation

and misery of the Great Depression, many people—including many economists—became more aware of

vulnerabilities within the market-oriented economic system. Some supporters of Keynesian economics

advocated a high degree of government planning in all parts of the economy.

However, Keynes himself was careful to separate the issue of aggregate demand from the issue of how well

individual markets worked. He argued that individual markets for goods and services were appropriate and

useful, but that sometimes that level of aggregate demand was just too low. When 10 million people are willing

and able to work, but one million of them are unemployed, he argued, individual markets may be doing a

perfectly good job of allocating the efforts of the nine million workers—the problem is that insufficient

aggregate demand exists to support jobs for all 10 million. Thus, he believed that, while government should

ensure that overall level of aggregate demand is sufficient for an economy to reach full employment, this task

did not imply that the government should attempt to set prices and wages throughout the economy, nor to take

over and manage large corporations or entire industries directly.

Even if one accepts the Keynesian economic theory, a number of practical questions remain. In the real world,
can government economists identify potential GDP accurately? Is a desired increase in aggregate demand

better accomplished by a tax cut or by an increase in government spending? Given the inevitable delays and

uncertainties as governments enact policies into law, is it reasonable to expect that the government can

implement Keynesian economics? Can fixing a recession really be just as simple as pumping up aggregate

demand? Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy will probe these issues. The Keynesian approach, with its

focus on aggregate demand and sticky prices, has proved useful in understanding how the economy fluctuates

in the short run and why recessions and cyclical unemployment occur. In The Neoclassical Perspective, we will

consider some of the shortcomings of the Keynesian approach and why it is not especially well-suited for long-

run macroeconomic analysis.

12.4 • The Keynesian Perspective on Market Forces 313

of this chapter, it was not started by the burst of a housing bubble. It was started by a virus that caused sickness and

death for millions of people worldwide and required substantial social policy in order to control its spread.

In some ways, the latest recession was influenced by fluctuations in aggregate demand. At its depth in April 2020,

over 20 million people were unemployed, causing a massive decline in consumption and aggregate demand. As

businesses were forced to shutter or move their operations online, many were pessimistic or uncertain about the

future state of the economy, causing investment to decline. The federal government attempted to correct this

aggregate demand shock through small business loans, direct aid to state and local governments, expanded

unemployment insurance, and stimulus checks. As a result of all these measures, the economy was able to bounce

back somewhat over the remainder of 2020. However, even at the start of 2022, millions of people remained out of

work as new variants threatened to upend the economy once again.

The Keynesian perspective would have economic policy continue to focus on aggregate and restoring confidence in

the economy. President Biden’s proposals largely reflect these goals, but with millions of workers still out of the

labor market and a virus that is still not contained, it remains to be seen whether those policy prescriptions will be

enough “medicine” to bring the economy back to normalcy.

Key Concepts and Summary

12.1 Aggregate Demand in Keynesian Analysis

Aggregate demand is the sum of four components: consumption, investment, government spending, and net

exports. Consumption will change for a number of reasons, including movements in income, taxes,

expectations about future income, and changes in wealth levels. Investment will change in response to its

expected profitability, which in turn is shaped by expectations about future economic growth, the creation of

new technologies, the price of key inputs, and tax incentives for investment. Investment will also change when

interest rates rise or fall. Political considerations determine government spending and taxes. Exports and

imports change according to relative growth rates and prices between two economies.

12.2 The Building Blocks of Keynesian Analysis

Keynesian economics is based on two main ideas: (1) aggregate demand is more likely than aggregate supply

to be the primary cause of a short-run economic event like a recession; (2) wages and prices can be sticky, and

so, in an economic downturn, unemployment can result. The latter is an example of a macroeconomic

externality. While surpluses cause prices to fall at the micro level, they do not necessarily at the macro level.

Instead the adjustment to a decrease in demand occurs only through decreased quantities. One reason why

prices may be sticky is menu costs, the costs of changing prices. These include internal costs a business faces

in changing prices in terms of labeling, recordkeeping, and accounting, and also the costs of communicating

the price change to (possibly unhappy) customers. Keynesians also believe in the existence of the expenditure

multiplier—the notion that a change in autonomous expenditure causes a more than proportionate change in

GDP.

12.3 The Phillips Curve

A Phillips curve shows the tradeoff between unemployment and inflation in an economy. From a Keynesian

viewpoint, the Phillips curve should slope down so that higher unemployment means lower inflation, and vice

versa. However, a downward-sloping Phillips curve is a short-term relationship that may shift after a few years.

12 • Self-Check Questions 315

Keynesian macroeconomics argues that the solution to a recession is expansionary fiscal policy, such as tax

cuts to stimulate consumption and investment, or direct increases in government spending that would shift

the aggregate demand curve to the right. The other side of Keynesian policy occurs when the economy is

operating above potential GDP. In this situation, unemployment is low, but inflationary rises in the price level

are a concern. The Keynesian response would be contractionary fiscal policy, using tax increases or

government spending cuts to shift AD to the left.

12.4 The Keynesian Perspective on Market Forces

The Keynesian prescription for stabilizing the economy implies government intervention at the

macroeconomic level—increasing aggregate demand when private demand falls and decreasing aggregate

demand when private demand rises. This does not imply that the government should be passing laws or

regulations that set prices and quantities in microeconomic markets.

Introduction to the Neoclassical Perspective

BRING IT HOME

Navigating Uncharted Waters
The Great Recession ended in June 2009 after 18 months, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research

(NBER). The NBER examines a variety of measures of economic activity to gauge the economy's overall health.

These measures include real income, wholesale and retail sales, employment, and industrial production. In the

years since the official end of this historic economic downturn, it has become clear that the Great Recession was

two-pronged, hitting the U.S. economy with the collapse of the housing market and the failure of the financial

system's credit institutions, further contaminating global economies. While the stock market rapidly lost trillions of

dollars of value, consumer spending dried up, and companies began cutting jobs, economic policymakers were

struggling with how to best combat and prevent a national, and even global economic collapse. In the end,

policymakers used a number of controversial monetary and fiscal policies to support the housing market and

domestic industries as well as to stabilize the financial sector. Some of these initiatives included:

318 13 • The Neoclassical Perspective

• Federal Reserve Bank purchase of both traditional and nontraditional assets off banks' balance sheets. By doing

this, the Fed injected money into the banking system and increased the amounts of funds available to lend to

the business sector and consumers. This also dropped short-term interest rates to as low as zero percent,

which had the effect of devaluing U.S. dollars in the global market and boosting exports.

• The Congress and the President also passed several pieces of legislation that would stabilize the financial

market. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), passed in late 2008, allowed the government to inject cash

into troubled banks and other financial institutions and help support General Motors and Chrysler as they faced

bankruptcy and threatened job losses throughout their supply chain. The American Recovery and Reinvestment

Act in early 2009 provided tax rebates to low- and middle-income households to encourage consumer

spending.

Four years after the end of the Great Recession, the economy had yet to return to its pre-recession levels of

productivity and growth. Annual productivity increased only 1.9% between 2009 and 2012 compared to its 2.7%

annual growth rate between 2000 and 2007, unemployment remained above the natural rate, and real GDP

continued to lag behind potential growth. The actions the government took to stabilize the economy were under

scrutiny and debate about their effectiveness continues. In this chapter, we will discuss the neoclassical perspective

on economics and compare it to the Keynesian perspective, using both the Great Recession and the more recent

pandemic-induced recession as examples.

In Chicago, Illinois, the highest recorded temperature was 105° in July 1995, while the lowest recorded

temperature was 27° below zero in January 1958. Understanding why these extreme weather patterns

occurred would be interesting. However, if you wanted to understand the typical weather pattern in Chicago,

instead of focusing on one-time extremes, you would need to look at the entire pattern of data over time.

A similar lesson applies to the study of macroeconomics. It is interesting to study extreme situations, like the

1930s Great Depression, the 2008–2009 Great Recession, or the pandemic-induced recession of 2020. If you

want to understand the whole picture, however, you need to look at the long term. Consider the unemployment

rate. The unemployment rate has fluctuated from as low as 3.5% in 1969 to as high as 9.7% in 1982 and 8.1%

in 2020. Even as the U.S. unemployment rate rose during recessions and declined during expansions, it kept

returning to the general neighborhood of 5.0%. When the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office carried out

its long-range economic forecasts in 2010, it assumed that from 2015 to 2020, after the recession has passed,

the unemployment rate would be 5.0%. In February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic, the unemployment

rate reached a historic low of 3.5% and is back to below 5% as of early 2022. From a long-run perspective, the

economy seems to keep adjusting back to this rate of unemployment.

As the name “neoclassical” implies, this perspective of how the macroeconomy works is a “new” view of the

“old” classical model of the economy. The classical view, the predominant economic philosophy until the Great

Depression, was that short-term fluctuations in economic activity would rather quickly, with flexible prices,

adjust back to full employment. This view of the economy implied a vertical aggregate supply curve at full

employment GDP, and prescribed a “hands off” policy approach. For example, if the economy were to slip into

recession (a leftward shift of the aggregate demand curve), it would temporarily exhibit a surplus of goods.

Falling prices would eliminate this surplus, and the economy would return to full employment level of GDP. No

active fiscal or monetary policy was needed. In fact, the classical view was that expansionary fiscal or

monetary policy would only cause inflation, rather than increase GDP. The deep and lasting impact of the Great

Depression changed this thinking and Keynesian economics, which prescribed active fiscal policy to alleviate

weak aggregate demand, became the more mainstream perspective.

13.1 The Building Blocks of Neoclassical Analysis

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain the importance of potential GDP in the long run

• Analyze the role of flexible prices

•

Interpret a neoclassical model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply

• Evaluate different ways for measuring the speed of macroeconomic adjustment

The neoclassical perspective on macroeconomics holds that, in the long run, the economy will fluctuate

around its potential GDP and its natural rate of unemployment. This chapter begins with two building blocks of

neoclassical economics: (1) potential GDP determines the economy's size and (2) wages and prices will adjust

in a flexible manner so that the economy will adjust back to its potential GDP level of output. The key policy

implication is this: The government should focus more on long-term growth and on controlling inflation than

on worrying about recession or cyclical unemployment. This focus on long-run growth rather than the short-

run fluctuations in the business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for long-run

macroeconomic analysis and Keynesian economics is more useful for analyzing the macroeconomic short
run. Let's consider the two neoclassical building blocks in turn, and how we can embody them in the aggregate
demand/aggregate supply model.

The Importance of Potential GDP in the Long Run

Over the long run, the level of potential GDP determines the size of real GDP. When economists refer to

“potential GDP” they are referring to that level of output that an economy can achieve when all resources (land,

labor, capital, and entrepreneurial ability) are fully employed. While the unemployment rate in labor markets

will never be zero, full employment in the labor market refers to zero cyclical unemployment. There will still be

some level of unemployment due to frictional or structural unemployment, but when the economy is operating

with zero cyclical unemployment, economists say that the economy is at the natural rate of unemployment or

at full employment.

Economists benchmark actual or real GDP against the potential GDP to determine how well the economy is

performing. As explained in Economic Growth, we can explain GDP growth by increases in investment in

physical capital and human capital per person as well as advances in technology. Physical capital per person

refers to the amount and kind of machinery and equipment available to help people get work done. Compare,

for example, your productivity in typing a term paper on a typewriter to working on your laptop with word

processing software. Clearly, you will be able to be more productive using word processing software. The

technology and level of capital of your laptop and software has increased your productivity. More broadly, the

development of GPS technology and Universal Product Codes (those barcodes on every product we buy) has
made it much easier for firms to track shipments, tabulate inventories, and sell and distribute products. These

two technological innovations, and many others, have increased a nation's ability to produce goods and

services for a given population. Likewise, increasing human capital involves increasing levels of knowledge,

education, and skill sets per person through vocational or higher education. Physical and human capital

improvements with technological advances will increase overall productivity and, thus, GDP.

To see how these improvements have increased productivity and output at the national level, we should

examine evidence from the United States. The United States experienced significant growth in the twentieth

century due to phenomenal changes in infrastructure, equipment, and technological improvements in

physical capital and human capital. The population more than tripled in the twentieth century, from 76 million

in 1900 to over 300 million in 2016. The human capital of modern workers is far higher today because the

education and skills of workers have risen dramatically. In 1900, only about one-eighth of the U.S. population

had completed high school and just one person in 40 had completed a four-year college degree. By 2010, about

8.5% of Americans age 25 or older had a high school degree and about 28% had a four-year college degree as

well. In 2019, 33% of Americans age 25 or older had a four-year college degree. The average amount of

320 13 • The Neoclassical Perspective

physical capital per worker has grown dramatically. The technology available to modern workers is

extraordinarily better than a century ago: cars, airplanes, electrical machinery, smartphones, computers,

chemical and biological advances, materials science, health care—the list of technological advances could run

on and on. More workers, higher skill levels, larger amounts of physical capital per worker, and amazingly

better technology, and potential GDP for the U.S. economy has clearly increased a great deal since 1900.

This growth has fallen below its potential GDP and, at times, has exceeded its potential. For example from

2008 to 2009, the U.S. economy tumbled into recession and remained below its potential until 2018. After the

pandemic-induced recession of March and April 2020, the economy again fell below potential GDP and

remains there as of early 2022. At other times, like in the late 1990s or from 2018 to 2020, the economy ran at

potential GDP—or even slightly ahead. Figure 13.2 shows the actual data for the increase in real GDP since

1960. The slightly smoother line shows the potential GDP since 1960 as estimated by the nonpartisan

Congressional Budget Office. Most economic recessions and upswings are times when the economy is 1–3%

below or above potential GDP in a given year. Clearly, short-run fluctuations around potential GDP do exist, but

over the long run, the upward trend of potential GDP determines the size of the economy.

FIGURE 13.2 Potential and Actual GDP (in 2012 Dollars), 1958–2020 Actual GDP falls below potential GDP during

and after recessions, like the recessions of 1980 and 1981–82, 1990–91, 2001, and 2008–2009 and continues

below potential GDP until 2019, when it goes slightly above potential. In other cases, actual GDP can be above

potential GDP for a time, as in the late 1990s.

In the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model, we show potential GDP as a vertical line. Neoclassical

economists who focus on potential GDP as the primary determinant of real GDP argue that the long-run

aggregate supply curve is located at potential GDP—that is, we draw the long-run aggregate supply curve as a

vertical line at the level of potential GDP, as Figure 13.3 shows. A vertical LRAS curve means that the level of

aggregate supply (or potential GDP) will determine the economy's real GDP, regardless of the level of aggregate

demand. Over time, increases in the quantity and quality of physical capital, increases in human capital, and

technological advancements shift potential GDP and the vertical LRAS curve gradually to the right. Economists

often describe this gradual increase in an economy's potential GDP as a nation's long-term economic growth.

13.1 • The Building Blocks of Neoclassical Analysis 321

FIGURE 13.3 A Vertical AS Curve In the neoclassical model, we draw the aggregate supply curve as a vertical line

at the level of potential GDP. If AS is vertical, then it determines the level of real output, no matter where we draw

the aggregate demand curve. Over time, the LRAS curve shifts to the right as productivity increases and potential

GDP expands.

The Role of Flexible Prices

How does the macroeconomy adjust back to its level of potential GDP in the long run? What if aggregate

demand increases or decreases? Economists base the neoclassical view of how the macroeconomy adjusts on

the insight that even if wages and prices are “sticky”, or slow to change, in the short run, they are flexible over

time. To understand this better, let's follow the connections from the short-run to the long-run macroeconomic

equilibrium.

The aggregate demand and aggregate supply diagram in Figure 13.4 shows two aggregate supply curves. We
draw the original upward sloping aggregate supply curve (SRAS0) is a short-run or Keynesian AS curve. The
vertical aggregate supply curve (LRASn) is the long-run or neoclassical AS curve, which is located at potential
GDP. The original aggregate demand curve, labeled AD0, so that the original equilibrium occurs at point E0, at
which point the economy is producing at its potential GDP.

FIGURE 13.4 The Rebound to Potential GDP after AD Increases The original equilibrium (E0), at an output level of
500 and a price level of 120, happens at the intersection of the aggregate demand curve (AD0) and the short-run
aggregate supply curve (SRAS0). The output at E0 is equal to potential GDP. Aggregate demand shifts right from AD0
to AD1. The new equilibrium is E1, with a higher output level of 550 and an increase in the price level to 125. With

322 13 • The Neoclassical Perspective

unemployment rates unsustainably low, eager employers bid up wages, which shifts short-run aggregate supply to
the left, from SRAS0 to SRAS1. The new equilibrium (E2) is at the same original level of output, 500, but at a higher
price level of 130. Thus, the long-run aggregate supply curve (LRASn), which is vertical at the level of potential GDP,

determines the level of real GDP in this economy in the long run.

Now, imagine that some economic event boosts aggregate demand: perhaps a surge of export sales or a rise in

business confidence that leads to more investment, perhaps a policy decision like higher government

spending, or perhaps a tax cut that leads to additional aggregate demand. The short-run Keynesian analysis is
that the rise in aggregate demand will shift the aggregate demand curve out to the right, from AD0 to AD1,
leading to a new equilibrium at point E1 with higher output, lower unemployment, and pressure for an
inflationary rise in the price level.

In the long-run neoclassical analysis, however, the chain of economic events is just beginning. As economic

output rises above potential GDP, the level of unemployment falls. The economy is now above full employment

and there is a labor shortage. Eager employers are trying to bid workers away from other companies and to

encourage their current workers to exert more effort and to work longer hours. This high demand for labor will

drive up wages. Most employers review their workers salaries only once or twice a year, and so it will take time
before the higher wages filter through the economy. As wages do rise, it will mean a leftward shift in the short-
run Keynesian aggregate supply curve back to SRAS1, because the price of a major input to production has
increased. The economy moves to a new equilibrium (E2). The new equilibrium has the same level of real GDP
as did the original equilibrium (E0), but there has been an inflationary increase in the price level.

This description of the short-run shift from E0 to E1 and the long-run shift from E1 to E2 is a step-by-step way
of making a simple point: the economy cannot sustain production above its potential GDP in the long run. An

economy may produce above its level of potential GDP in the short run, under pressure from a surge in

aggregate demand. Over the long run, however, that surge in aggregate demand ends up as an increase in the

price level, not as a rise in output.

The rebound of the economy back to potential GDP also works in response to a shift to the left in aggregate
demand. Figure 13.5 again starts with two aggregate supply curves, with SRAS0 showing the original upward
sloping short-run Keynesian AS curve and LRASn showing the vertical long-run neoclassical aggregate supply

curve. A decrease in aggregate demand—for example, because of a decline in consumer confidence that leads
to less consumption and more saving—causes the original aggregate demand curve AD0 to shift back to AD1.
The shift from the original equilibrium (E0) to the new equilibrium (E1) results in a decline in output. The
economy is now below full employment and there is a surplus of labor. As output falls below potential GDP,

unemployment rises. While a lower price level (i.e., deflation) is rare in the United States, it does happen

occasionally during very weak periods of economic activity. For practical purposes, we might consider a lower

price level in the AD–AS model as indicative of disinflation, which is a decline in the inflation rate. Thus, the

long-run aggregate supply curve LRASn, which is vertical at the level of potential GDP, ultimately determines

this economy's real GDP.

13.1 • The Building Blocks of Neoclassical Analysis 323

FIGURE 13.5 A Rebound Back to Potential GDP from a Shift to the Left in Aggregate Demand The original
equilibrium (E0), at an output level of 500 and a price level of 120, happens at the intersection of the aggregate
demand curve (AD0) and the short-run aggregate supply curve (SRAS0). The output at E0 is equal to potential GDP.
Aggregate demand shifts left, from AD0 to AD1. The new equilibrium is at E1, with a lower output level of 450 and
downward pressure on the price level of 115. With high unemployment rates, wages are held down. Lower wages

are an economy-wide decrease in the price of a key input, which shifts short-run aggregate supply to the right, from
SRAS0 to SRAS1. The new equilibrium (E2) is at the same original level of output, 500, but at a lower price level of
110.

Again, from the neoclassical perspective, this short-run scenario is only the beginning of the chain of events.

The higher level of unemployment means more workers looking for jobs. As a result, employers can hold down

on pay increases—or perhaps even replace some of their higher-paid workers with unemployed people willing

to accept a lower wage. As wages stagnate or fall, this decline in the price of a key input means that the short-
run Keynesian aggregate supply curve shifts to the right from its original (SRAS0 to SRAS1). The overall impact
in the long run, as the macroeconomic equilibrium shifts from E0 to E1 to E2, is that the level of output returns
to potential GDP, where it started. There is, however, downward pressure on the price level. Thus, in the

neoclassical view, changes in aggregate demand can have a short-run impact on output and on

unemployment—but only a short-run impact. In the long run, when wages and prices are flexible, potential

GDP and aggregate supply determine real GDP's size.

How Fast Is the Speed of Macroeconomic Adjustment?

How long does it take for wages and prices to adjust, and for the economy to rebound to its potential GDP? This

subject is highly contentious. Keynesian economists argue that if the adjustment from recession to potential

GDP takes a very long time, then neoclassical theory may be more hypothetical than practical. In response to

John Maynard Keynes' immortal words, “In the long run we are all dead,” neoclassical economists respond that

even if the adjustment takes as long as, say, ten years the neoclassical perspective remains of central

importance in understanding the economy.

One subset of neoclassical economists holds that wage and price adjustment in the macroeconomy might be

quite rapid. The theory of rational expectations holds that people form the most accurate possible

expectations about the future that they can, using all information available to them. In an economy where most
people have rational expectations, economic adjustments may happen very quickly.

To understand how rational expectations may affect the speed of price adjustments, think about a situation in

the real estate market. Imagine that several events seem likely to push up home values in the neighborhood.

Perhaps a local employer announces that it plans to hire many more people or the city announces that it will

324 13 • The Neoclassical Perspective

build a local park or a library in that neighborhood. The theory of rational expectations points out that even

though none of the changes will happen immediately, home prices in the neighborhood will rise immediately,

because the expectation that homes will be worth more in the future will lead buyers to be willing to pay more

in the present. The amount of the immediate increase in home prices will depend on how likely it seems that

the announcements about the future will actually happen and on how distant the local jobs and neighborhood

improvements are in the future. The key point is that, because of rational expectations, prices do not wait on

events, but adjust immediately.

At a macroeconomic level, the theory of rational expectations points out that if the aggregate supply curve is

vertical over time, then people should rationally expect this pattern. When a shift in aggregate demand occurs,

people and businesses with rational expectations will know that its impact on output and employment will be

temporary, while its impact on the price level will be permanent. If firms and workers perceive the outcome of

the process in advance, and if all firms and workers know that everyone else is perceiving the process in the

same way, then they have no incentive to go through an extended series of short-run scenarios, like a firm first

hiring more people when aggregate demand shifts out and then firing those same people when aggregate

supply shifts back. Instead, everyone will recognize where this process is heading—toward a change in the

price level—and then will act on that expectation. In this scenario, the expected long-run change in the price

level may happen very quickly, without a drawn-out zigzag of output and employment first moving one way

and then the other.

The theory that people and firms have rational expectations can be a useful simplification, but as a statement

about how people and businesses actually behave, the assumption seems too strong. After all, many people

and firms are not especially well informed, either about what is happening in the economy or about how the

economy works. An alternate assumption is that people and firms act with adaptive expectations: they look at

past experience and gradually adapt their beliefs and behavior as circumstances change, but are not perfect

synthesizers of information and accurate predictors of the future in the sense of rational expectations theory.

If most people and businesses have some form of adaptive expectations, then the adjustment from the short

run and long run will be traced out in incremental steps that occur over time.

The empirical evidence on the speed of macroeconomic adjustment of prices and wages is not clear-cut. The

speed of macroeconomic adjustment probably varies among different countries and time periods. A

reasonable guess is that the initial short-run effect of a shift in aggregate demand might last two to five years,

before the adjustments in wages and prices cause the economy to adjust back to potential GDP. Thus, one

might think of the short run for applying Keynesian analysis as time periods less than two to five years, and the

long run for applying neoclassical analysis as longer than five years. For practical purposes, this guideline is

frustratingly imprecise, but when analyzing a complex social mechanism like an economy as it evolves over

time, some imprecision seems unavoidable.

13.2 The Policy Implications of the Neoclassical Perspective

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Discuss why and how economists measure inflation expectations

• Analyze the impacts of fiscal and monetary policy on aggregate supply and aggregate demand

• Explain the neoclassical Phillips curve, noting its tradeoff between inflation and unemployment

•

Identify clear distinctions between neoclassical economics and Keynesian economics

To understand the policy recommendations of the neoclassical economists, it helps to start with the Keynesian

perspective. Suppose a decrease in aggregate demand causes the economy to go into recession with high

unemployment. The Keynesian response would be to use government policy to stimulate aggregate demand

and eliminate the recessionary gap. The neoclassical economists believe that the Keynesian response, while

perhaps well intentioned, will not have a good outcome for reasons we will discuss shortly. Since the

neoclassical economists believe that the economy will correct itself over time, the only advantage of a

13.2 • The Policy Implications of the Neoclassical Perspective 325

Keynesian stabilization policy would be to accelerate the process and minimize the time that the unemployed

are out of work. Is that the likely outcome?

Keynesian macroeconomic policy requires some optimism about the government's ability to recognize a

situation of too little or too much aggregate demand, and to adjust aggregate demand accordingly with the

right level of changes in taxes or spending, all enacted in a timely fashion. After all, neoclassical economists

argue, it takes government statisticians months to produce even preliminary estimates of GDP so that

politicians know whether a recession is occurring—and those preliminary estimates may be revised

substantially later. Moreover, there is the question of timely action. The political process can take more months

to enact a tax cut or a spending increase. Political or economic considerations may determine the amount of

tax or spending changes. Then the economy will take still more months to put into effect changes in aggregate

demand through spending and production. When economists and policy makers consider all of these time lags

and political realities, active fiscal policy may fail to address the current problem, and could even make the

future economy worse. The average U.S. post-World War II recession has lasted only about a year. By the time

government policy activates, the recession will likely be over. As a consequence, the only result of government

fine-tuning will be to stimulate the economy when it is already recovering (or to contract the economy when it

is already falling). In other words, an active macroeconomic policy is likely to exacerbate the cycles rather than

dampen them. Some neoclassical economists believe a large part of the business cycles we observe are due to

flawed government policy. To learn about this issue further, read the following Clear It Up feature.

CLEAR IT UP

Why and how do economists measure inflation expectations?
People take expectations about inflation into consideration every time they make a major purchase, such as a house

or a car. As inflation fluctuates, so too does the nominal interest rate on loans to buy these goods. The nominal

interest rate is comprised of the real rate, plus an expected inflation factor. Expected inflation also tells economists

about how the public views the economy's direction. Suppose the public expects inflation to increase. This could be

the result of positive demand shock due to an expanding economy and increasing aggregate demand. It could also

be the result of a negative supply shock, perhaps from rising energy prices, and decreasing aggregate supply. In

either case, the public may expect the central bank to engage in contractionary monetary policy to reduce inflation,

and this policy results in higher interest rates. If, however economists expect inflation to decrease, the public may

anticipate a recession. In turn, the public may expect expansionary monetary policy, and lower interest rates, in the

short run. By monitoring expected inflation, economists garner information about the effectiveness of

macroeconomic policies. Additionally, monitoring expected inflation allows for projecting the direction of real

interest rates that isolate for the effect of inflation. This information is necessary for making decisions about

financing investments.

Expectations about inflation may seem like a highly theoretical concept, but, in fact the Federal Reserve Bank

measures, inflation expectations based upon early research conducted by Joseph Livingston, a financial journalist

for the Philadelphia Inquirer. In 1946, he started a twice-a-year survey of economists about their expectations of

inflation. After Livingston's death in 1969, the Federal Reserve Bank and other economic research agencies such as

the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan, the American Statistical Association, and the National

Bureau of Economic Research continued the survey.

Current Federal Reserve research compares these expectations to actual inflation that has occurred, and the

results, so far, are mixed. Economists' forecasts, however, have become notably more accurate in the last few

decades. Economists are actively researching how inflation expectations and other economic variables form and

change.

The Neoclassical Phillips Curve Tradeoff

The Keynesian Perspective introduced the Phillips curve and explained how it is derived from the aggregate

supply curve. The short run upward sloping aggregate supply curve implies a downward sloping Phillips

curve; thus, there is a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment in the short run. By contrast, a

neoclassical long-run aggregate supply curve will imply a vertical shape for the Phillips curve, indicating no

long run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. Figure 13.6 (a) shows the vertical AS curve, with three

different levels of aggregate demand, resulting in three different equilibria, at three different price levels. At

every point along that vertical AS curve, potential GDP and the rate of unemployment remains the same.

Assume that for this economy, the natural rate of unemployment is 5%. As a result, the long-run Phillips curve

relationship, in Figure 13.6 (b), is a vertical line, rising up from 5% unemployment, at any level of inflation.

Read the following Work It Out feature for additional information on how to interpret inflation and

unemployment rates.

FIGURE 13.6 From a Long-Run AS Curve to a Long-Run Phillips Curve (a) With a vertical LRAS curve, shifts in

aggregate demand do not alter the level of output but do lead to changes in the price level. Because output is
unchanged between the equilibria E0, E1, and E2, all unemployment in this economy will be due to the natural rate of
unemployment. (b) If the natural rate of unemployment is 5%, then the Phillips curve will be vertical. That is,

regardless of changes in the price level, the unemployment rate remains at 5%.

Step 1. Plot the data points in a graph with inflation rate on the vertical axis and unemployment rate on the

horizontal axis. Your graph will appear similar to Figure 13.7.

FIGURE 13.7 Inflation Rates

Step 2. What patterns do you see in the data? You should notice that there are years when unemployment falls

but inflation rises, and other years where unemployment rises and inflation falls.

Step 3. Can you determine the natural rate of unemployment from the data or from the graph? As you analyze the

graph, it appears that the natural rate of unemployment lies at 4%. This is the rate that the economy appears to

adjust back to after an apparent change in the economy. For example, in 1975 the economy appeared to have an

increase in aggregate demand. The unemployment rate fell to 3% but inflation increased from 2% to 3%. By

1980, the economy had adjusted back to 4% unemployment and the inflation rate had returned to 2%. In 1985,

the economy looks to have suffered a recession as unemployment rose to 6% and inflation fell to 1%. This would

be consistent with a decrease in aggregate demand. By 1990, the economy recovered back to 4%

unemployment, but at a lower inflation rate of 1%. In 1995 the economy again rebounded and unemployment

fell to 2%, but inflation increased to 4%, which is consistent with a large increase in aggregate demand. The

328 13 • The Neoclassical Perspective

economy adjusted back to 4% unemployment but at a higher rate of inflation of 5%. Then in 2000, both

unemployment and inflation increased to 5% and 4%, respectively.

Step 4. Do you see the Phillips curve(s) in the data? If we trace the downward sloping trend of data points, we

could see a short-run Phillips curve that exhibits the inverse tradeoff between higher unemployment and lower

inflation rates. If we trace the vertical line of data points, we could see a long-run Phillips curve at the 4% natural

rate of unemployment.

The unemployment rate on the long-run Phillips curve will be the natural rate of unemployment. A small
inflationary increase in the price level from AD0 to AD1 will have the same natural rate of unemployment as a
larger inflationary increase in the price level from AD0 to AD2. The macroeconomic equilibrium along the
vertical aggregate supply curve can occur at a variety of different price levels, and the natural rate of

unemployment can be consistent with all different rates of inflation. The great economist Milton Friedman

(1912–2006) summed up the neoclassical view of the long-term Phillips curve tradeoff in a 1967 speech:

“[T]here is always a temporary trade-off between inflation and unemployment; there is no permanent trade-

off.”

In the Keynesian perspective, the primary focus is on getting the level of aggregate demand right in

relationship to an upward-sloping aggregate supply curve. That is, the government should adjust AD so that

the economy produces at its potential GDP, not so low that cyclical unemployment results and not so high that

inflation results. In the neoclassical perspective, aggregate supply will determine output at potential GDP, the

natural rate of unemployment determines unemployment, and shifts in aggregate demand are the primary

determinant of changes in the price level.

Fighting Unemployment or Inflation?

As we explained in Unemployment, economists divide unemployment into two categories: cyclical

unemployment and the natural rate of unemployment, which is the sum of frictional and structural

unemployment. Cyclical unemployment results from fluctuations in the business cycle and is created when

the economy is producing below potential GDP—giving potential employers less incentive to hire. When the

economy is producing at potential GDP, cyclical unemployment will be zero. Because of labor market

dynamics, in which people are always entering or exiting the labor force, the unemployment rate never falls to

0%, not even when the economy is producing at or even slightly above potential GDP. Probably the best we can

hope for is for the number of job vacancies to equal the number of job seekers. We know that it takes time for

job seekers and employers to find each other, and this time is the cause of frictional unemployment. Most

economists do not consider frictional unemployment to be a “bad” thing. After all, there will always be workers

who are unemployed while looking for a job that is a better match for their skills. There will always be

employers that have an open position, while looking for a worker that is a better match for the job. Ideally,

these matches happen quickly, but even when the economy is very strong there will be some natural

unemployment and this is what the natural rate of unemployment measures.

The neoclassical view of unemployment tends to focus attention away from the cyclical unemployment

problem—that is, unemployment caused by recession—while putting more attention on the unemployment

rate issue that prevails even when the economy is operating at potential GDP. To put it another way, the

neoclassical view of unemployment tends to focus on how the government can adjust public policy to reduce

the natural rate of unemployment. Such policy changes might involve redesigning unemployment and welfare

programs so that they support those in need, but also offer greater encouragement for job-hunting. It might

13.2 • The Policy Implications of the Neoclassical Perspective 329

involve redesigning business rules with an eye to whether they are unintentionally discouraging businesses

from taking on new employees. It might involve building institutions to improve the flow of information about

jobs and the mobility of workers, to help bring workers and employers together more quickly. For those

workers who find that their skills are permanently no longer in demand (for example, the structurally

unemployed), economists can design policy to provide opportunities for retraining so that these workers can

reenter the labor force and seek employment.

Neoclassical economists will not tend to see aggregate demand as a useful tool for reducing unemployment;

after all, with a vertical aggregate supply curve determining economic output, then aggregate demand has no

long-run effect on unemployment. Instead, neoclassical economists believe that aggregate demand should be

allowed to expand only to match the gradual shifts of aggregate supply to the right—keeping the price level

much the same and inflationary pressures low.

If aggregate demand rises rapidly in the neoclassical model, in the long run it leads only to inflationary

pressures. Figure 13.8 shows a vertical LRAS curve and three different levels of aggregate demand, rising from
AD0 to AD1 to AD2. As the macroeconomic equilibrium rises from E0 to E1 to E2, the price level rises, but real
GDP does not budge; nor does the rate of unemployment, which adjusts to its natural rate. Conversely,
reducing inflation has no long-term costs, either. Think about Figure 13.8 in reverse, as the aggregate demand
curve shifts from AD2 to AD1 to AD0, and the equilibrium moves from E2 to E1 to E0. During this process, the
price level falls, but, in the long run, neither real GDP nor the natural unemployment rate changes.

FIGURE 13.8 How Aggregate Demand Determines the Price Level in the Long Run As aggregate demand shifts to
the right, from AD0 to AD1 to AD2, real GDP in this economy and the level of unemployment do not change. However,
there is inflationary pressure for a higher price level as the equilibrium changes from E0 to E1 to E2.

Fighting Recession or Encouraging Long-Term Growth?

Neoclassical economists believe that the economy will rebound out of a recession or eventually contract during

an expansion because prices and wage rates are flexible and will adjust either upward or downward to restore

the economy to its potential GDP. Thus, the key policy question for neoclassicals is how to promote growth of

potential GDP. We know that economic growth ultimately depends on the growth rate of long-term productivity.

330 13 • The Neoclassical Perspective

Productivity measures how effective inputs are at producing outputs. We know that U.S. productivity has

grown on average about 2% per year. That means that the same amount of inputs produce 2% more output

than the year before. We also know that productivity growth varies a great deal in the short term due to cyclical

factors. It also varies somewhat in the long term. From 1953–1972, U.S. labor productivity (as measured by

output per hour in the business sector) grew at 3.2% per year. From 1973–1992, productivity growth declined

significantly to 1.8% per year. Then, from 1993–2010, productivity growth increased to around 2% per year. In

recent years, it has grown less than 2% per year, although it did pick up in 2019 and 2020 to over 2% again.

The neoclassical economists believe the underpinnings of long-run productivity growth to be an economy’s

investments in human capital, physical capital, and technology, operating together in a market-oriented

environment that rewards innovation. Government policy should focus on promoting these factors.

Summary of Neoclassical Macroeconomic Policy Recommendations

Let’s summarize what neoclassical economists recommend for macroeconomic policy. Neoclassical

economists do not believe in “fine-tuning” the economy. They believe that a stable economic environment with

a low rate of inflation fosters economic growth. Similarly, tax rates should be low and unchanging. In this

environment, private economic agents can make the best possible investment decisions, which will lead to
optimal investment in physical and human capital as well as research and development to promote
improvements in technology.

13.3 • Balancing Keynesian and Neoclassical Models 331

13.3 Balancing Keynesian and Neoclassical Models

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Evaluate how neoclassical economists and Keynesian economists react to recessions

• Analyze the interrelationship between the neoclassical and Keynesian economic models

We can compare finding the balance between Keynesian and Neoclassical models to the challenge of riding

two horses simultaneously. When a circus performer stands on two horses, with a foot on each one, much of

the excitement for the viewer lies in contemplating the gap between the two. As modern macroeconomists ride

into the future on two horses—with one foot on the short-term Keynesian perspective and one foot on the long-

term neoclassical perspective—the balancing act may look uncomfortable, but there does not seem to be any

way to avoid it. Each approach, Keynesian and neoclassical, has its strengths and weaknesses.

The short-term Keynesian model, built on the importance of aggregate demand as a cause of business cycles

and a degree of wage and price rigidity, does a sound job of explaining many recessions and why cyclical

unemployment rises and falls. By focusing on the short-run aggregate demand adjustments, Keynesian

economics risks overlooking the long-term causes of economic growth or the natural rate of unemployment

that exist even when the economy is producing at potential GDP.

The neoclassical model, with its emphasis on aggregate supply, focuses on the underlying determinants of

output and employment in markets, and thus tends to put more emphasis on economic growth and how labor

markets work. However, the neoclassical view is not especially helpful in explaining why unemployment

moves up and down over short time horizons of a few years. Nor is the neoclassical model especially helpful

when the economy is mired in an especially deep and long-lasting recession, like the 1930s Great Depression.

Keynesian economics tends to view inflation as a price that might sometimes be paid for lower unemployment;

neoclassical economics tends to view inflation as a cost that offers no offsetting gains in terms of lower

unemployment.

Macroeconomics cannot, however, be summed up as an argument between one group of economists who are

pure Keynesians and another group who are pure neoclassicists. Instead, many mainstream economists

believe both the Keynesian and neoclassical perspectives. Robert Solow, the Nobel laureate in economics in

1987, described the dual approach in this way:

At short time scales, I think, something sort of ‘Keynesian’ is a good approximation, and surely better

than anything straight ‘neoclassical.’ At very long time scales, the interesting questions are best

studied in a neoclassical framework, and attention to the Keynesian side of things would be a minor

distraction. At the five-to-ten-year time scale, we have to piece things together as best we can, and

look for a hybrid model that will do the job.

Many modern macroeconomists spend considerable time and energy trying to construct models that blend the

most attractive aspects of the Keynesian and neoclassical approaches. It is possible to construct a somewhat

complex mathematical model where aggregate demand and sticky wages and prices matter in the short run,

but wages, prices, and aggregate supply adjust in the long run. However, creating an overall model that

encompasses both short-term Keynesian and long-term neoclassical models is not easy.

Navigating Uncharted Waters—The Great Recession and Pandemic-Induced Recession of 2020
Were the policies that the government implemented to stabilize the economy and financial markets during the Great

Recession of 2007–2009, and the pandemic-induced recession of 2020 effective? Many economists from both the

Keynesian and neoclassical schools have found that they were, although to varying degrees. Regarding the Great

Recession, Alan Blinder of Princeton University and Mark Zandi for Moody’s Analytics found that, without fiscal

332 13 • The Neoclassical Perspective

policy, GDP decline would have been significantly more than its 3.3% in 2008 followed by its 0.1% decline in 2009.

They also estimated that there would have been 8.5 million more job losses had the government not intervened in

the market with the TARP to support the financial industry and key automakers General Motors and Chrysler.

Federal Reserve Bank economists Carlos Carvalho, Stefano Eusip, and Christian Grisse found in their study, Policy

Initiatives in the Global Recession: What Did Forecasters Expect?that once the government implemented policies,

forecasters adapted their expectations to these policies. They were more likely to anticipate increases in investment

due to lower interest rates brought on by monetary policy and increased economic growth resulting from fiscal

policy.

The neoclassical perspective can also shed light on the country’s experience with policy during the pandemic-

induced recession of 2020. It was mentioned earlier that one criticism made by proponents of the neoclassical

perspective is that government policy is often too slow to react to a recession. However after the pandemic hit, the

federal government quickly responded with aid to state and local governments, increased unemployment insurance,

aid to businesses forced to shut down, and stimulus checks to boost spending. There is no doubt that the economic

fallout from the pandemic would have been much worse without these policies. Some economists even argue that

the government helped too much and that the high inflation the U.S. economy experienced starting mid-2021 is due

to the real output growing faster than potential, but it is too early (as of early 2022) to tell if that argument is correct.

By focusing on potential GDP instead of short-run demand, the neoclassical perspective also makes an important

point about how the size of the economy determines its ability to grow. Since the pandemic hit, millions of workers

have stayed out of the labor market due to early retirement, health and safety concerns, the availability of childcare,

and school closures. As mentioned in Unemployment, these changes have caused labor force participation to

remain lower than its historical average. The pandemic has also made it harder for future workers to acquire skills

they need to be productive in the labor market. The longer these dynamics are at play, the more harm it will do to

potential GDP.

Key Concepts and Summary

13.1 The Building Blocks of Neoclassical Analysis

The neoclassical perspective argues that, in the long run, the economy will adjust back to its potential GDP

level of output through flexible price levels. Thus, the neoclassical perspective views the long-run AS curve as

vertical. A rational expectations perspective argues that people have excellent information about economic
events and how the economy works and that, as a result, price and other economic adjustments will happen

very quickly. In adaptive expectations theory, people have limited information about economic information

and how the economy works, and so price and other economic adjustments can be slow.

13.2 The Policy Implications of the Neoclassical Perspective

Neoclassical economists tend to put relatively more emphasis on long-term growth than on fighting recession,

because they believe that recessions will fade in a few years and long-term growth will ultimately determine

the standard of living. They tend to focus more on reducing the natural rate of unemployment caused by

economic institutions and government policies than the cyclical unemployment caused by recession.

Neoclassical economists also see no social benefit to inflation. With an upward-sloping Keynesian AS curve,

inflation can arise because an economy is approaching full employment. With a vertical long-run neoclassical

AS curve, inflation does not accompany any rise in output. If aggregate supply is vertical, then aggregate

demand does not affect the quantity of output. Instead, aggregate demand can only cause inflationary changes

in the price level. A vertical aggregate supply curve, where the quantity of output is consistent with many

different price levels, also implies a vertical Phillips curve.

13.3 Balancing Keynesian and Neoclassical Models

The Keynesian perspective considers changes to aggregate demand to be the cause of business cycle
fluctuations. Keynesians are likely to advocate that policy makers actively attempt to reverse recessionary and

inflationary periods because they are not convinced that the self-correcting economy can easily return to full

employment.

The neoclassical perspective places more emphasis on aggregate supply. Neoclassical economists believe that

long term productivity growth determines the potential GDP level and that the economy typically will return to

full employment after a change in aggregate demand. Skeptical of the effectiveness and timeliness of

Keynesian policy, neoclassical economists are more likely to advocate a hands-off, or fairly limited, role for

active stabilization policy.

While Keynesians would tend to advocate an acceptable tradeoff between inflation and unemployment when

counteracting a recession, neoclassical economists argue that no such tradeoff exists. Any short-term gains in

lower unemployment will eventually vanish and the result of active policy will only be inflation.

BRING IT HOME

The Many Disguises of Money: From Cowries to Crypto
Here is a trivia question: In the history of the world, what item did people use for money over the broadest

geographic area and for the longest period of time? The answer is not gold, silver, or any precious metal. It is the

cowrie, a mollusk shell found mainly off the Maldives Islands in the Indian Ocean. Cowries served as money as early

as 700 B.C. in China. By the 1500s, they were in widespread use across India and Africa. For several centuries after

that, cowries were the means for exchange in markets including southern Europe, western Africa, India, and China:

everything from buying lunch or a ferry ride to paying for a shipload of silk or rice. Cowries were still acceptable as a

338 14 • Money and Banking

way of paying taxes in certain African nations in the early twentieth century.

What made cowries work so well as money? First, they are extremely durable—lasting a century or more. As the late

economic historian Karl Polyani put it, they can be “poured, sacked, shoveled, hoarded in heaps” while remaining

“clean, dainty, stainless, polished, and milk-white.” Second, parties could use cowries either by counting shells of a

certain size, or—for large purchases—by measuring the weight or volume of the total shells they would exchange.

Third, it was impossible to counterfeit a cowrie shell, but dishonest people could counterfeit gold or silver coins by

making copies with cheaper metals. Finally, in the heyday of cowrie money, from the 1500s into the 1800s,

governments, first the Portuguese, then the Dutch and English, tightly controlled collecting cowries. As a result, the

supply of cowries grew quickly enough to serve the needs of commerce, but not so quickly that they were no longer

scarce. Money throughout the ages has taken many different forms and continues to evolve even today with the

advent of cryptocurrency. What do you think money is?

The discussion of money and banking is a central component in studying macroeconomics. At this point, you

should have firmly in mind the main goals of macroeconomics from Welcome to Economics!: economic

growth, low unemployment, and low inflation. We have yet to discuss money and its role in helping to achieve

our macroeconomic goals.

You should also understand Keynesian and neoclassical frameworks for macroeconomic analysis and how we

can embody these frameworks in the aggregate demand/aggregate supply (AD/AS) model. With the goals and

frameworks for macroeconomic analysis in mind, the final step is to discuss the two main categories of

macroeconomic policy: monetary policy, which focuses on money, banking and interest rates; and fiscal

policy, which focuses on government spending, taxes, and borrowing. This chapter discusses what economists

mean by money, and how money is closely interrelated with the banking system. Monetary Policy and Bank

Regulation furthers this discussion.

14.1 Defining Money by Its Functions

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain the various functions of money

• Contrast commodity money and fiat money

Money for the sake of money is not an end in itself. You cannot eat dollar bills or wear your bank account.

Ultimately, the usefulness of money rests in exchanging it for goods or services. As the American writer and

humorist Ambrose Bierce (1842–1914) wrote in 1911, money is a “blessing that is of no advantage to us

excepting when we part with it.” Money is what people regularly use when purchasing or selling goods and

services, and thus both buyers and sellers must widely accept money. This concept of money is intentionally

flexible, because money has taken a wide variety of forms in different cultures.

Barter and the Double Coincidence of Wants

To understand the usefulness of money, we must consider what the world would be like without money. How

would people exchange goods and services? Economies without money typically engage in the barter system.

Barter—literally trading one good or service for another—is highly inefficient for trying to coordinate the

trades in a modern advanced economy. In an economy without money, an exchange between two people would

involve a double coincidence of wants, a situation in which two people each want some good or service that

the other person can provide. For example, if an accountant wants a pair of shoes, this accountant must find

someone who has a pair of shoes in the correct size and who is willing to exchange the shoes for some hours of

accounting services. Such a trade is likely to be difficult to arrange. Think about the complexity of such trades

in a modern economy, with its extensive division of labor that involves thousands upon thousands of different

jobs and goods.

Access for free at openstax.org

14.1 • Defining Money by Its Functions 339

Another problem with the barter system is that it does not allow us to easily enter into future contracts for

purchasing many goods and services. For example, if the goods are perishable it may be difficult to exchange

them for other goods in the future. Imagine a farmer wanting to buy a tractor in six months using a fresh crop

of strawberries. Additionally, while the barter system might work adequately in small economies, it will keep

these economies from growing. The time that individuals would otherwise spend producing goods and

services and enjoying leisure time they spend bartering.

Functions for Money

Money solves the problems that the barter system creates. (We will get to its definition soon.) First, money

serves as a medium of exchange, which means that money acts as an intermediary between the buyer and the

seller. Instead of exchanging accounting services for shoes, the accountant now exchanges accounting services

for money. The accountant then uses this money to buy shoes. To serve as a medium of exchange, people must

widely accept money as a method of payment in the markets for goods, labor, and financial capital.

Second, money must serve as a store of value. In a barter system, we saw the example of the shoemaker

trading shoes for accounting services. However, she risks having her shoes go out of style, especially if she

keeps them in a warehouse for future use—their value will decrease with each season. Shoes are not a good

store of value. Holding money is a much easier way of storing value. You know that you do not need to spend it

immediately because it will still hold its value the next day, or the next year. This function of money does not

require that money is a perfectstore of value. In an economy with inflation, money loses some buying power

each year, but it remains money.

Third, money serves as a unit of account, which means that it is the ruler by which we measure values. For

example, an accountant may charge $100 to file your tax return. That $100 can purchase two pair of shoes at

$50 a pair. Money acts as a common denominator, an accounting method that simplifies thinking about trade-

offs.

Finally, another function of money is that it must serve as a standard of deferred payment. This means that if

money is usable today to make purchases, it must also be acceptable to make purchases today that the

purchaser will pay in the future. Loans and future agreements are stated in monetary terms and the standard

of deferred payment is what allows us to buy goods and services today and pay in the future. Thus, money

serves all of these functions— it is a medium of exchange, store of value, unit of account, and standard of

deferred payment.

Commodity versus Fiat Money

Money has taken a wide variety of forms in different cultures. People have used gold, silver, cowrie shells,

cigarettes, and even cocoa beans as money. Although we use these items as commodity money, they also have
a value from use as something other than money. For example, people have used gold throughout the ages as

money although today we do not use it as money but rather value it for its other attributes. Gold is a good

conductor of electricity and the electronics and aerospace industry use it. Other industries use gold too, such

as to manufacture energy efficient reflective glass for skyscrapers and is used in the medical industry as well.

Of course, gold also has value because of its beauty and malleability in creating jewelry.

As commodity money, gold has historically served its purpose as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and

as a unit of account. Commodity-backed currencies are dollar bills or other currencies with values backed up

by gold or other commodities held at a bank. During much of its history, gold and silver backed the money

supply in the United States. Interestingly, antique dollars dated as late as 1957, have “Silver Certificate”

printed over the portrait of George Washington, as Figure 14.2 shows. This meant that the holder could take

the bill to the appropriate bank and exchange it for a dollar’s worth of silver.

340 14 • Money and Banking

FIGURE 14.2 A Silver Certificate and a Modern U.S. Bill Until 1958, silver certificates were commodity-backed

money—backed by silver, as indicated by the words “Silver Certificate” printed on the bill. Today, The Federal

Reserve backs U.S. bills, but as fiat money (inconvertible paper money made legal tender by a government decree).

As economies grew and became more global in nature, the use of commodity monies became more

cumbersome. Countries moved towards the use of fiat money. Fiat money has no intrinsic value, but is

declared by a government to be a country's legal tender. The United States’ paper money, for example, carries

the statement: “THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE.” In other words, by

government decree, if you owe a debt, then legally speaking, you can pay that debt with the U.S. currency, even

though it is not backed by a commodity. The only backing of our money is universal faith and trust that the

currency has value, and nothing more.

14.2 Measuring Money: Currency, M1, and M2

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Contrast M1 money supply and M2 money supply
• Classify monies as M1 money supply or M2 money supply

Cash in your pocket certainly serves as money; however, what about checks or credit cards? Are they money,

too? Rather than trying to state a single way of measuring money, economists offer broader definitions of

money based on liquidity. Liquidity refers to how quickly you can use a financial asset to buy a good or service.

For example, cash is very liquid. You can use your $10 bill easily to buy a hamburger at lunchtime. However,

$10 that you have in your savings account is not so easy to use. You must go to the bank or ATM machine and

withdraw that cash to buy your lunch. Thus, $10 in your savings account is lessliquid.

The Federal Reserve Bank, which is the central bank of the United States, is a bank regulator and is

responsible for monetary policy and defines money according to its liquidity. There are two definitions of

money: M1 and M2 money supply. Historically, M1 money supply included those monies that are very liquid

such as cash, checkable (demand) deposits, and traveler’s checks, while M2 money supply included those

monies that are less liquid in nature; M2 included M1 plus savings and time deposits, certificates of deposits,

and money market funds. Beginning in May 2020, the Federal Reserve changed the definition of both M1 and

Access for free at openstax.org

14.2 • Measuring Money: Currency, M1, and M2 341

M2. The biggest change is that savings moved to be part of M1. M1 money supply now includes cash, checkable

(demand) deposits, and savings. M2 money supply is now measured as M1 plus time deposits, certificates of

deposits, and money market funds.

M1 money supply includes coins and currency in circulation—the coins and bills that circulate in an

economy that the U.S. Treasury does not hold at the Federal Reserve Bank, or in bank vaults. Closely related to

currency are checkable deposits, also known as demand deposits. These are the amounts held in checking

accounts. They are called demand deposits or checkable deposits because the banking institution must give

the deposit holder his money “on demand” when the customer writes a check or uses a debit card. These items

together—currency, and checking accounts in banks—comprise the definition of money known as M1, which

the Federal Reserve System measures daily.

As mentioned, M1 now includes savings deposits in banks, which are bank accounts on which you cannot

write a check directly, but from which you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or

bank.

A broader definition of money, M2 includes everything in M1 but also adds other types of deposits. Many banks

and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in money market funds, where they pool together

the deposits of many individual investors and invest them in a safe way, such as short-term government bonds.

Another ingredient of M2 are the relatively small (that is, less than about $100,000) certificates of deposit (CDs)

or time deposits, which are accounts that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain

period of time, ranging from a few months to a few years, in exchange for a higher interest rate. In short, all

these types of M2 are money that you can withdraw and spend, but which require a greater effort to do so than

the items in M1. Figure 14.3 should help in visualizing the relationship between M1 and M2. Note that M1 is

included in the M2 calculation.

342 14 • Money and Banking

FIGURE 14.3 The Relationship between M1 and M2 Money M1 and M2 money have several definitions, ranging from

narrow to broad. M1 = coins and currency in circulation + checkable (demand) deposit + savings deposits. M2 = M1

+ money market funds + certificates of deposit + other time deposits.

The Federal Reserve System is responsible for tracking the amounts of M1 and M2 and prepares a weekly

release of information about the money supply. To provide an idea of what these amounts sound like,

according to the Federal Reserve Bank’s measure of the U.S. money stock, at the end of November 2021, M1 in

the United States was $20.3 trillion, while M2 was $21.4 trillion. Table 14.1 provides a breakdown of the

portion of each type of money that comprised M1 and M2 in November 2021, as provided by the Federal

Reserve Bank.

The lines separating M1 and M2 can become a little blurry. Sometimes businesses do not treat elements of M1

alike. For example, some businesses will not accept personal checks for large amounts, but will accept

traveler’s checks or cash. Changes in banking practices and technology have made the savings accounts in M2
more similar to the checking accounts in M1. For example, some savings accounts will allow depositors to

write checks, use automatic teller machines, and pay bills over the internet, which has made it easier to access

savings accounts. As with many other economic terms and statistics, the important point is to know the

strengths and limitations of the various definitions of money, not to believe that such definitions are as clear-

cut to economists as, say, the definition of nitrogen is to chemists.

Where does “plastic money” like debit cards, credit cards, and smart money fit into this picture? A debit card,

like a check, is an instruction to the user’s bank to transfer money directly and immediately from your bank

account to the seller. It is important to note that in our definition of money, it is checkable depositsthat are

money, not the paper check or the debit card. Although you can make a purchase with a credit card, the

financial institution does not consider it money but rather a short term loan from the credit card company to

you. When you make a credit card purchase, the credit card company immediately transfers money from its

checking account to the seller, and at the end of the month, the credit card company sends you a bill for what

you have charged that month. Until you pay the credit card bill, you have effectively borrowed money from the

credit card company. With a smart card, you can store a certain value of money on the card and then use the

card to make purchases. Some “smart cards” used for specific purposes, like long-distance phone calls or

making purchases at a campus bookstore and cafeteria, are not really all that smart, because you can only use

them for certain purchases or in certain places.

In short, credit cards, debit cards, and smart cards are different ways to move money when you make a
purchase. However, having more credit cards or debit cards does not change the quantity of money in the

economy, any more than printing more checks increases the amount of money in your checking account.

One key message underlying this discussion of M1 and M2 is that money in a modern economy is not just

paper bills and coins. Instead, money is closely linked to bank accounts. The banking system largely conducts

macroeconomic policies concerning money. The next section explains how banks function and how a nation’s

banking system has the power to create money.

14.3 The Role of Banks

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain how banks act as intermediaries between savers and borrowers

• Evaluate the relationship between banks, savings and loans, and credit unions

• Analyze the causes of bankruptcy and recessions

Somebody once asked the late bank robber named Willie Sutton why he robbed banks. He answered: “That’s

where the money is.” While this may have been true at one time, from the perspective of modern economists,

Sutton is both right and wrong. He is wrong because the overwhelming majority of money in the economy is

not in the form of currency sitting in vaults or drawers at banks, waiting for a robber to appear. Most money is

in the form of bank accounts, which exist only as electronic records on computers. From a broader

perspective, however, the bank robber was more right than he may have known. Banking is intimately

interconnected with money and consequently, with the broader economy.

Banks make it far easier for a complex economy to carry out the extraordinary range of transactions that occur

in goods, labor, and financial capital markets. Imagine for a moment what the economy would be like if

everybody had to make all payments in cash. When shopping for a large purchase or going on vacation you

might need to carry hundreds of dollars in a pocket or purse. Even small businesses would need stockpiles of

cash to pay workers and to purchase supplies. A bank allows people and businesses to store this money in

either a checking account or savings account, for example, and then withdraw this money as needed through

the use of a direct withdrawal, writing a check, or using a debit card.

Banks are a critical intermediary in what we call the payment system, which helps an economy exchange

goods and services for money or other financial assets. Also, those with extra money that they would like to

save can store their money in a bank rather than look for an individual who is willing to borrow it from them

and then repay them at a later date. Those who want to borrow money can go directly to a bank rather than

trying to find someone to lend them cash. Transaction costs are the costs associated with finding a lender or a

borrower for this money. Thus, banks lower transactions costs and act as financial intermediaries—they bring

savers and borrowers together. Along with making transactions much safer and easier, banks also play a key

role in creating money.

Banks as Financial Intermediaries

An “intermediary” is one who stands between two other parties. Banks are a financial intermediary—that is,

an institution that operates between a saver who deposits money in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan

from that bank. Financial intermediaries include other institutions in the financial market such as insurance

companies and pension funds, but we will not include them in this discussion because they are not depository

institutions, which are institutions that accept money depositsand then use these to make loans. All the

deposited funds mingle in one big pool, which the financial institution then lends. Figure 14.4 illustrates the

position of banks as financial intermediaries, with deposits flowing into a bank and loans flowing out. Of

course, when banks make loans to firms, the banks will try to funnel financial capital to healthy businesses

that have good prospects for repaying the loans, not to firms that are suffering losses and may be unable to

repay.

14.3 • The Role of Banks 345

FIGURE 14.4 Banks as Financial Intermediaries Banks act as financial intermediaries because they stand between

savers and borrowers. Savers place deposits with banks, and then receive interest payments and withdraw money.

Borrowers receive loans from banks and repay the loans with interest. In turn, banks return money to savers in the

form of withdrawals, which also include interest payments from banks to savers.

CLEAR IT UP

How are banks, savings and loans, and credit unions related?
Banks have a couple of close cousins: savings institutions and credit unions. Banks, as we explained, receive

deposits from individuals and businesses and make loans with the money. Savings institutions are also sometimes

called “savings and loans” or “thrifts.” They also take loans and make deposits. However, from the 1930s until the

1980s, federal law limited how much interest savings institutions were allowed to pay to depositors. They were also

required to make most of their loans in the form of housing-related loans, either to homebuyers or to real-estate

developers and builders.

A credit union is a nonprofit financial institution that its members own and run. Members of each credit union decide

who is eligible to be a member. Usually, potential members would be everyone in a certain community, or groups of

employees, or members of a certain organization. The credit union accepts deposits from members and focuses on

making loans back to its members. While there are more credit unions than banks and more banks than savings and

loans, the total assets of credit unions are growing.

In 2008, there were 7,085 banks. Due to the bank failures of 2007–2009 and bank mergers, there were 5,571

banks in the United States at the end of the fourth quarter in 2014. By 2020, there were 4,374 commercial banks

and 627 savings institutions. According to the National Credit Union Association, as of September 2021 there were

4,990 credit unions with assets totaling $2.0 trillion. A day of “Transfer Your Money” took place in 2009 out of

general public disgust with big bank bailouts. People were encouraged to transfer their deposits to credit unions.

This has grown into the ongoing Move Your Money Project. Consequently, some now hold assets with a total value as

large as $111 billion.

A Bank’s Balance Sheet

A balance sheet is an accounting tool that lists assets and liabilities. An asset is something of value that you

own and you can use to produce something. For example, you can use the cash you own to pay your tuition. If

you own a home, this is also an asset. A liability is a debt or something you owe. Many people borrow money to

buy homes. In this case, a home is the asset, but the mortgage is the liability. The net worth is the asset value

minus how much is owed (the liability). A bank’s balance sheet operates in much the same way. A bank’s net

worth as bank capital. We also refer to a bank has assets such as cash held in its vaults, monies that the bank

346 14 • Money and Banking

holds at the Federal Reserve bank (called “reserves”), loans that it makes to customers, and bonds.

Figure 14.5 illustrates a hypothetical and simplified balance sheet for the Safe and Secure Bank. Because of the

two-column format of the balance sheet, with the T-shape formed by the vertical line down the middle and the

horizontal line under “Assets” and “Liabilities,” we sometimes call it a T-account.

FIGURE 14.5 A Balance Sheet for the Safe and Secure Bank

The “T” in a T-account separates the assets of a firm, on the left, from its liabilities, on the right. All firms use

T-accounts, though most are much more complex. For a bank, the assets are the financial instruments that

either the bank is holding (its reserves) or those instruments where other parties owe money to the bank—like

loans made by the bank and U.S. Government Securities, such as U.S. treasury bonds purchased by the bank.

Liabilities are what the bank owes to others. Specifically, the bank owes any deposits made in the bank to those
who have made them. The net worth of the bank is the total assets minus total liabilities. Net worth is included
on the liabilities side to have the T account balance to zero. For a healthy business, net worth will be positive.

For a bankrupt firm, net worth will be negative. In either case, on a bank’s T-account, assets will always equal

liabilities plus net worth.

When bank customers deposit money into a checking account, savings account, or a certificate of deposit, the

bank views these deposits as liabilities. After all, the bank owes these deposits to its customers, when the

customers wish to withdraw their money. In the example in Figure 14.5, the Safe and Secure Bank holds $10

million in deposits.

Loans are the first category of bank assets in Figure 14.5. Say that a family takes out a 30-year mortgage loan to

purchase a house, which means that the borrower will repay the loan over the next 30 years. This loan is

clearly an asset from the bank’s perspective, because the borrower has a legal obligation to make payments to

the bank over time. However, in practical terms, how can we measure the value of the mortgage loan that the

borrower is paying over 30 years in the present? One way of measuring the value of something—whether a loan

or anything else—is by estimating what another party in the market is willing to pay for it. Many banks issue

home loans, and charge various handling and processing fees for doing so, but then sell the loans to other

banks or financial institutions who collect the loan payments. We call the market where financial institutions

make loans to borrowers the primary loan market, while the market in which financial institutions buy and sell

these loans is the secondary loan market.

One key factor that affects what financial institutions are willing to pay for a loan, when they buy it in the

secondary loan market, is the perceived riskiness of the loan: that is, given the borrower's characteristics, such

as income level and whether the local economy is performing strongly, what proportion of loans of this type

will the borrower repay? The greater the risk that a borrower will not repay loan, the less that any financial

institution will pay to acquire the loan. Another key factor is to compare the interest rate the financial

institution charged on the original loan with the current interest rate in the economy. If the original loan

requires the borrower to pay a low interest rate, but current interest rates are relatively high, then a financial

institution will pay less to acquire the loan. In contrast, if the original loan requires the borrower to pay a high

interest rate, while current interest rates are relatively low, then a financial institution will pay more to acquire

the loan. For the Safe and Secure Bank in this example, the total value of its loans if they sold them to other

financial institutions in the secondary market is $5 million.

The second category of bank asset is bonds, which are a common mechanism for borrowing, used by the

federal and local government, and also private companies, and nonprofit organizations. A bank takes some of

the money it has received in deposits and uses the money to buy bonds—typically bonds issued that the U.S.

Access for free at openstax.org

14.3 • The Role of Banks 347

government issues. Government bonds are low-risk because the government is virtually certain to pay off the

bond, albeit at a low rate of interest. These bonds are an asset for banks in the same way that loans are an

asset: The bank will receive a stream of payments in the future. In our example, the Safe and Secure Bank

holds bonds worth a total value of $4 million.

The final entry under assets is reserves, which is money that the bank keeps on hand, and that it does not lend

or invest in bonds—and thus does not lead to interest payments. The Federal Reserve requires that banks keep

a certain percentage of depositors’ money on “reserve,” which means either in their vaults or at the Federal

Reserve Bank. We call this a reserve requirement. (Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation will explain how the

level of these required reserves are one policy tool that governments have to influence bank behavior.)

Additionally, banks may also want to keep a certain amount of reserves on hand in excess of what is required.

The Safe and Secure Bank is holding $2 million in reserves.

We define net worth of a bank as its total assets minus its total liabilities. For the Safe and Secure Bank in

Figure 14.5, net worth is equal to $1 million; that is, $11 million in assets minus $10 million in liabilities. For a

financially healthy bank, the net worth will be positive. If a bank has negative net worth and depositors tried to

withdraw their money, the bank would not be able to give all depositors their money.

For some concrete examples of what banks do, watch this video (http://openstax.org/l/makingsense) from Paul

Solman’s “Making Sense of Financial News.”

How Banks Go Bankrupt

A bank that is bankrupt will have a negative net worth, meaning its assets will be worth less than its liabilities.

How can this happen? Again, looking at the balance sheet helps to explain.

A well-run bank will assume that a small percentage of borrowers will not repay their loans on time, or at all,

and factor these missing payments into its planning. Remember, the calculations of the banks' expenses every

year include a factor for loans that borrowers do not repay, and the value of a bank’s loans on its balance sheet

assumes a certain level of riskiness because some customers will not repay loans. Even if a bank expects a

certain number of loan defaults, it will suffer if the number of loan defaults is much greater than expected, as

can happen during a recession. For example, if the Safe and Secure Bank in Figure 14.5 experienced a wave of

unexpected defaults, so that its loans declined in value from $5 million to $3 million, then the assets of the Safe

and Secure Bank would decline so that the bank had negative net worth.

CLEAR IT UP

What led to the 2008–2009 financial crisis?
Many banks make mortgage loans so that people can buy a home, but then do not keep the loans on their books as

an asset. Instead, the bank sells the loan. These loans are “securitized,” which means that they are bundled

together into a financial security that a financial institution sells to investors. Investors in these mortgage-backed

securities receive a rate of return based on the level of payments that people make on all the mortgages that stand

behind the security.

Securitization offers certain advantages. If a bank makes most of its loans in a local area, then the bank may be

financially vulnerable if the local economy declines, so that many people are unable to make their payments.

However, if a bank sells its local loans, and then buys a mortgage-backed security based on home loans in many

parts of the country, it can avoid exposure to local financial risks. (In the simple example in the text, banks just own

“bonds.” In reality, banks can own a number of financial instruments, as long as these financial investments are safe

enough to satisfy the government bank regulators.) From the standpoint of a local homebuyer, securitization offers

348 14 • Money and Banking

the benefit that a local bank does not need to have significant extra funds to make a loan, because the bank is only

planning to hold that loan for a short time, before selling the loan so that it can pool it into a financial security.

However, securitization also offers one potentially large disadvantage. If a bank plans to hold a mortgage loan as an

asset, the bank has an incentive to scrutinize the borrower carefully to ensure that the customer is likely to repay

the loan. However, a bank that plans to sell the loan may be less careful in making the loan in the first place. The

bank will be more willing to make what we call “subprime loans,” which are loans that have characteristics like low

or zero down-payment, little scrutiny of whether the borrower has a reliable income, and sometimes low payments

for the first year or two that will be followed by much higher payments. Economists dubbed some of the subprime

loans made by financial institutions in the mid-2000s NINJA loans: loans that financial institutions made even

though the borrower had demonstrated No Income, No Job, or Assets.

Financial institutions typically sold these subprime loans and turned them into financial securities—but with a twist.

The idea was that if losses occurred on these mortgage-backed securities, certain investors would agree to take the

first, say, 5% of such losses. Other investors would agree to take, say, the next 5% of losses. By this approach, still

other investors would not need to take any losses unless these mortgage-backed financial securities lost 25% or

30% or more of their total value. These complex securities, along with other economic factors, encouraged a large
expansion of subprime loans in the mid-2000s.

The economic stage was now set for a banking crisis. Banks thought they were buying only ultra-safe securities,

because even though the securities were ultimately backed by risky subprime mortgages, the banks only invested in

the part of those securities where they were protected from small or moderate levels of losses. However, as housing

prices fell after 2007, and the deepening recession made it harder for many people to make their mortgage

payments, many banks found that their mortgage-backed financial assets could be worth much less than they had

expected—and so the banks were faced with staring bankruptcy. In the 2008–2011 period, 318 banks failed in the

United States.

The risk of an unexpectedly high level of loan defaults can be especially difficult for banks because a bank’s

liabilities, namely it customers' deposits. Customers can withdraw funds quickly but many of the bank’s assets

like loans and bonds will only be repaid over years or even decades. This asset-liability time mismatch—the

ability for customers to withdraw bank’s liabilities in the short term while customers repay its assets in the

long term—can cause severe problems for a bank. For example, imagine a bank that has loaned a substantial

amount of money at a certain interest rate, but then sees interest rates rise substantially. The bank can find

itself in a precarious situation. If it does not raise the interest rate it pays to depositors, then deposits will flow

to other institutions that offer the higher interest rates that are now prevailing. However, if the bank raises the

interest rates that it pays to depositors, it may end up in a situation where it is paying a higher interest rate to

depositors than it is collecting from those past loans that it at lower interest rates. Clearly, the bank cannot

survive in the long term if it is paying out more in interest to depositors than it is receiving from borrowers.

How can banks protect themselves against an unexpectedly high rate of loan defaults and against the risk of an

asset-liability time mismatch? One strategy is for a bank to diversify its loans, which means lending to a

variety of customers. For example, suppose a bank specialized in lending to a niche market—say, making a

high proportion of its loans to construction companies that build offices in one downtown area. If that one area

suffers an unexpected economic downturn, the bank will suffer large losses. However, if a bank loans both to

consumers who are buying homes and cars and also to a wide range of firms in many industries and

geographic areas, the bank is less exposed to risk. When a bank diversifies its loans, those categories of

borrowers who have an unexpectedly large number of defaults will tend to be balanced out, according to

random chance, by other borrowers who have an unexpectedly low number of defaults. Thus, diversification of

loans can help banks to keep a positive net worth. However, if a widespread recession occurs that touches

many industries and geographic areas, diversification will not help.

Along with diversifying their loans, banks have several other strategies to reduce the risk of an unexpectedly

14.4 • How Banks Create Money 349

large number of loan defaults. For example, banks can sell some of the loans they make in the secondary loan

market, as we described earlier, and instead hold a greater share of assets in the form of government bonds or

reserves. Nevertheless, in a lengthy recession, most banks will see their net worth decline because customers

will not repay a higher share of loans in tough economic times.

14.4 How Banks Create Money

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Utilize the money multiplier formulate to determine how banks create money

• Analyze and create T-account balance sheets

• Evaluate the risks and benefits of money and banks

Banks and money are intertwined. It is not just that most money is in the form of bank accounts. The banking

system can literally create money through the process of making loans. Let’s see how.

Money Creation by a Single Bank

Start with a hypothetical bank called Singleton Bank. The bank has $10 million in deposits. The T-account

balance sheet for Singleton Bank, when it holds all of the deposits in its vaults, is in Figure 14.6. At this stage,

Singleton Bank is simply storing money for depositors and is using these deposits to make loans. In this

simplified example, Singleton Bank cannot earn any interest income from these loans and cannot pay its

depositors an interest rate either.

FIGURE 14.6 Singleton Bank’s Balance Sheet: Receives $10 million in Deposits

The Federal Reserve requires Singleton Bank to keep $1 million on reserve (10% of total deposits). It will loan

out the remaining $9 million. By loaning out the $9 million and charging interest, it will be able to make

interest payments to depositors and earn interest income for Singleton Bank (for now, we will keep it simple

and not put interest income on the balance sheet). Instead of becoming just a storage place for deposits,

Singleton Bank can become a financial intermediary between savers and borrowers.

This change in business plan alters Singleton Bank’s balance sheet, as Figure 14.7 shows. Singleton’s assets

have changed. It now has $1 million in reserves and a loan to Hank’s Auto Supply of $9 million. The bank still

has $10 million in deposits.

FIGURE 14.7 Singleton Bank’s Balance Sheet: 10% Reserves, One Round of Loans

Singleton Bank lends $9 million to Hank’s Auto Supply. The bank records this loan by making an entry on the

balance sheet to indicate that it has made a loan. This loan is an asset, because it will generate interest income

for the bank. Of course, the loan officer will not allow let Hank to walk out of the bank with $9 million in cash.

The bank issues Hank’s Auto Supply a cashier’s check for the $9 million. Hank deposits the loan in his regular

checking account with First National. The deposits at First National rise by $9 million and its reserves also rise

by $9 million, as Figure 14.8 shows. First National must hold 10% of additional deposits as required reserves

but is free to loan out the rest

350 14 • Money and Banking

FIGURE 14.8 First National Balance Sheet

Making loans that are deposited into a demand deposit account increases the M1 money supply. Remember

the definition of M1 includes checkable (demand) deposits, which one can easily use as a medium of exchange

to buy goods and services. Notice that the money supply is now $19 million: $10 million in deposits in

Singleton bank and $9 million in deposits at First National. Obviously as Hank’s Auto Supply writes checks to

pay its bills the deposits will draw down. However, the bigger picture is that a bank must hold enough money in

reserves to meet its liabilities. The rest the bank loans out. In this example so far, bank lending has expanded

the money supply by $9 million.

Now, First National must hold only 10% as required reserves ($900,000) but can lend out the other 90% ($8.1

million) in a loan to Jack’s Chevy Dealership as Figure 14.9 shows.

FIGURE 14.9 First National Balance Sheet

If Jack’s deposits the loan in its checking account at Second National, the money supply just increased by an

additional $8.1 million, as Figure 14.10 shows.

FIGURE 14.10 Second National Bank’s Balance Sheet

How is this money creation possible? It is possible because there are multiple banks in the financial system,

they are required to hold only a fraction of their deposits, and loans end up deposited in other banks, which

increases deposits and, in essence, the money supply.

The Money Multiplier and a Multi-Bank System

In a system with multiple banks, Singleton Bank deposited the initial excess reserve amount that it decided to

lend to Hank’s Auto Supply into First National Bank, which is free to loan out $8.1 million. If all banks loan out

their excess reserves, the money supply will expand. In a multi-bank system, institutions determine the

amount of money that the system can create by using the money multiplier. This tells us by how many times a

loan will be “multiplied” as it is spent in the economy and then re-deposited in other banks.

Fortunately, a formula exists for calculating the total of these many rounds of lending in a banking system. The

money multiplier formula is:

We then multiply the money multiplier by the change in excess reserves to determine the total amount of M1

money supply created in the banking system. See the Work it Out feature to walk through the multiplier

calculation.

WORK IT OUT

Using the Money Multiplier Formula
Using the money multiplier for the example in this text:

Step 1. In the case of Singleton Bank, for whom the reserve requirement is 10% (or 0.10), the money multiplier is

1 divided by .10, which is equal to 10.

Step 2. We have identified that the excess reserves are $9 million, so, using the formula we can determine the

total change in the M1 money supply:

Step 3. Thus, we can say that, in this example, the total quantity of money generated in this economy after all

rounds of lending are completed will be $90 million.

Cautions about the Money Multiplier

The money multiplier will depend on the proportion of reserves that the Federal Reserve Band requires banks

to hold. Additionally, a bank can also choose to hold extra reserves. Banks may decide to vary how much they

hold in reserves for two reasons: macroeconomic conditions and government rules. When an economy is in

recession, banks are likely to hold a higher proportion of reserves because they fear that customers are less

likely to repay loans when the economy is slow. The Federal Reserve may also raise or lower the required

reserves held by banks as a policy move to affect the quantity of money in an economy, as Monetary Policy and

Bank Regulation will discuss.

The process of how banks create money shows how the quantity of money in an economy is closely linked to

the quantity of lending or credit in the economy. All the money in the economy, except for the original reserves,

is a result of bank loans that institutions repeatedly re-deposit and loan.

Finally, the money multiplier depends on people re-depositing the money that they receive in the banking

system. If people instead store their cash in safe-deposit boxes or in shoeboxes hidden in their closets, then

banks cannot recirculate the money in the form of loans. Central banks have an incentive to assure that bank

deposits are safe because if people worry that they may lose their bank deposits, they may start holding more

money in cash, instead of depositing it in banks, and the quantity of loans in an economy will decline. Low-

income countries have what economists sometimes refer to as “mattress savings,” or money that people are

hiding in their homes because they do not trust banks. When mattress savings in an economy are substantial,

banks cannot lend out those funds and the money multiplier cannot operate as effectively. The overall quantity

of money and loans in such an economy will decline.

Money and Banks—Benefits and Dangers

Money and banks are marvelous social inventions that help a modern economy to function. Compared with the

alternative of barter, money makes market exchanges vastly easier in goods, labor, and financial markets.

Banking makes money still more effective in facilitating exchanges in goods and labor markets. Moreover, the

352 14 • Money and Banking

process of banks making loans in financial capital markets is intimately tied to the creation of money.

However, the extraordinary economic gains that are possible through money and banking also suggest some

possible corresponding dangers. If banks are not working well, it sets off a decline in convenience and safety of

transactions throughout the economy. If the banks are under financial stress, because of a widespread decline

in the value of their assets, loans may become far less available, which can deal a crushing blow to sectors of

the economy that depend on borrowed money like business investment, home construction, and car

manufacturing. The 2008–2009 Great Recession illustrated this pattern.

The Many Disguises of Money: From Cowries to Crypto
The global economy has come a long way since it started using cowrie shells as currency. We have moved away from

commodity and commodity-backed paper money to fiat currency. As technology and global integration increases,

the need for paper currency is diminishing, too. Every day, we witness the increased use of debit and credit cards.

The latest creation and a new form of money is cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is digital currency that is not

controlled by any single entity, such as a company or country. In this sense, it is not a fiat currency because it is not
issued by a central bank and is not necessarily supported by governments as legal tender. Instead, transactions and

ownership are maintained in a decentralized manner, and the value (vis-à-vis, say, the U.S. dollar) is determined

primarily by market forces—i.e., supply and demand. Governments can affect the value of a cryptocurrency by

regulating its use within their country's boundaries, but in the end, the price of a cryptocurrency comes down to

supply and demand. Cryptocurrencies have come a long way since 2009 when Bitcoin was first invented, and the

recent two to three years has seen an explosion of different cryptocurrencies being used across the globe.

It is important to note that in order to be considered as money, cryptocurrency still needs to satisfy the three

requirements: it needs to be valid as a store of value, it needs to be valid as a unit of account, and it must be able to

be used as a medium of exchange. While the first two of these requirements can be satisfied easily by expressing

the currency in terms of another, such as the U.S. dollar, and through its secure ownership rules, its use as a medium

of exchange—to be used to buy and sell goods and services—is more complicated. While cryptocurrencies are used

in many illicit transactions, it is less common to see them accepted as forms of payment for regular things like

groceries or your rent.

Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency, and thus the one most likely to be considered real money since it can be

used to purchase the most goods and services. Other popular cryptocurrencies as of early 2022 (in terms of trade

volume) are Ethereum and Binance Coin. Many other cryptocurrencies exist, but their more widespread adoption as

a medium of exchange is yet to be seen.

Key Concepts and Summary

14.1 Defining Money by Its Functions

Money is what people in a society regularly use when purchasing or selling goods and services. If money were

not available, people would need to barter with each other, meaning that each person would need to identify

others with whom they have a double coincidence of wants—that is, each party has a specific good or service

that the other desires. Money serves several functions: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of

value, and a standard of deferred payment. There are two types of money: commodity money, which is an item

used as money, but which also has value from its use as something other than money; and fiat money, which

has no intrinsic value, but is declared by a government to be the country's legal tender.

14.2 Measuring Money: Currency, M1, and M2

We measure money with several definitions: M1 includes currency and money in checking accounts (demand

deposits). Traveler’s checks are also a component of M1, but are declining in use. M2 includes all of M1, plus

savings deposits, time deposits like certificates of deposit, and money market funds.

14.3 The Role of Banks

Banks facilitate using money for transactions in the economy because people and firms can use bank accounts

when selling or buying goods and services, when paying a worker or receiving payment, and when saving

money or receiving a loan. In the financial capital market, banks are financial intermediaries; that is, they

operate between savers who supply financial capital and borrowers who demand loans. A balance sheet

(sometimes called a T-account) is an accounting tool which lists assets in one column and liabilities in another.

The bank's liabilities are its deposits. The bank's assets include its loans, its ownership of bonds, and its

reserves (which it does not loan out). We calculate a bank's net worth by subtracting its liabilities from its

assets. Banks run a risk of negative net worth if the value of their assets declines. The value of assets can

decline because of an unexpectedly high number of defaults on loans, or if interest rates rise and the bank

suffers an asset-liability time mismatch in which the bank is receiving a low interest rate on its long-term

loans but must pay the currently higher market interest rate to attract depositors. Banks can protect
themselves against these risks by choosing to diversify their loans or to hold a greater proportion of their

assets in bonds and reserves. If banks hold only a fraction of their deposits as reserves, then the process of

banks’ lending money, re-depositing those loans in banks, and the banks making additional loans will create

money in the economy.

14.4 How Banks Create Money

We define the money multiplier as the quantity of money that the banking system can generate from each $1 of

bank reserves. The formula for calculating the multiplier is 1/reserve ratio, where the reserve ratio is the

fraction of deposits that the bank wishes to hold as reserves. The quantity of money in an economy and the

quantity of credit for loans are inextricably intertwined. The network of banks making loans, people making

deposits, and banks making more loans creates much of the money in an economy.

Given the macroeconomic dangers of a malfunctioning banking system, Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation

will discuss government policies for controlling the money supply and for keeping the banking system safe.

Introduction to Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation

BRING IT HOME

The Problem of the Zero Percent Interest Rate Lower Bound
Most economists believe that monetary policy (the manipulation of interest rates and credit conditions by a nation’s

central bank) has a powerful influence on a nation’s economy. Monetary policy works when the central bank reduces

interest rates and makes credit more available. As a result, business investment and other types of spending

increase, causing GDP and employment to grow.

However, what if the interest rates banks pay are close to zero already? They cannot be made negative, can they?

That would mean that lenders pay borrowers for the privilege of taking their money. Yet, this was the situation the

358 15 • Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation

U.S. Federal Reserve found itself in both at the end of the 2008–2009 recession and during the COVID-19 recession

of 2020. The federal funds rate, which is the interest rate for banks that the Federal Reserve targets with its

monetary policy, was slightly above 5% in 2007. By 2009, it had fallen to 0.16%. It then fell again from over 2% to

0.05% in March 2020.

During the Great Recession, the Federal Reserve’s situation was further complicated because fiscal policy, the other

major tool for managing the economy, was constrained by fears that the federal budget deficit and the public debt

were already too high. What were the Federal Reserve’s options? How could the Federal Reserve use monetary

policy to stimulate the economy? And while fiscal policy was more aggressive in 2020, the economic situation has in

some cases been more severe and additional financial support was necessary. The solution to the problem of the

lower bound in both recessions, as we will see in this chapter, was to change the rules of the game.

Money, loans, and banks are all interconnected. Money is deposited in bank accounts, which is then loaned to

businesses, individuals, and other banks. When the interlocking system of money, loans, and banks works

well, economic transactions smoothly occur in goods and labor markets and savers are connected with

borrowers. If the money and banking system does not operate smoothly, the economy can either fall into

recession or suffer prolonged inflation.

The government of every country has public policies that support the system of money, loans, and banking.

However, these policies do not always work perfectly. This chapter discusses how monetary policy works and

what may prevent it from working perfectly.

15.1 The Federal Reserve Banking System and Central Banks

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain the structure and organization of the U.S. Federal Reserve

• Discuss how central banks impact monetary policy, promote financial stability, and provide banking

services

In making decisions about the money supply, a central bank decides whether to raise or lower interest rates

and, in this way, to influence macroeconomic policy, whose goal is low unemployment and low inflation. The

central bank is also responsible for regulating all or part of the nation’s banking system to protect bank

depositors and insure the health of the bank’s balance sheet.

We call the organization responsible for conducting monetary policy and ensuring that a nation’s financial

system operates smoothly the central bank. Most nations have central banks or currency boards. Some

prominent central banks around the world include the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the
Bank of England. In the United States, we call the central bank the Federal Reserve—often abbreviated as just

“the Fed.” This section explains the U.S. Federal Reserve's organization and identifies the major central bank's

responsibilities.

Structure/Organization of the Federal Reserve

Unlike most central banks, the Federal Reserve is semi-decentralized, mixing government appointees with

representation from private-sector banks. At the national level, it is run by a Board of Governors, consisting of

seven members appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. Appointments

are for 14-year terms and they are arranged so that one term expires January 31 of every even-numbered year.

The purpose of the long and staggered terms is to insulate the Board of Governors as much as possible from

political pressure so that governors can make policy decisions based only on their economic merits.

Additionally, except when filling an unfinished term, each member only serves one term, further insulating

decision-making from politics. The Fed's policy decisions do not require congressional approval, and the

President cannot ask for a Federal Reserve Governor to resign as the President can with cabinet positions.

One member of the Board of Governors is designated as the Chair. For example, from 1987 until early 2006,

the Chair was Alan Greenspan. From 2006 until 2014, Ben Bernanke held the post. From 2014 to 2018, Janet

Yellen was the Chair. The current Chair is Jerome Powell. See the following Clear It Up feature to find out more

about the former and current Chair.

Who has the most immediate economic power in the world?

What individual can make a financial market crash or soar just by making a public statement? It is not Bill Gates or

Warren Buffett. It is not even the President of the United States. The answer is the Chair of the Federal Reserve

Board of Governors. In 2018, President Donald Trump appointed Jerome H. Powell to a 4-year term as chair of the

Federal Reserve, replacing Janet Yellen, who served as the first female chair of the Federal Reserve from

2014–2018 and who now serves as the Treasury Secretary in the Biden administration. In November 2021, Powell

was nominated for a second term by President Biden; this appointment was confirmed in early-2022.

Powell played a pivotal role during the COVID-19 recession and its aftermath; in March 2020, under his leadership

the Fed acted quickly to reduce the effective federal funds rate and expand its lending and bond-buying actions,

similar to what Ben Bernanke did during the Great Recession. A centrist at heart, Powell has been criticized for

fueling asset prices, even though in his many speeches and testimony before Congress he has consistently

emphasized low unemployment rates and has been more tolerant of inflation than others on the Federal Reserve

Board. Powell is not an academic economist by training or career—he has a J.D. from Georgetown Law and worked

for many years at investment banks and on corporate boards—but this lack of "ivory tower" influences has helped

guide a practical approach to economic problems, for which he is best known.

The Fed Chair is first among equals on the Board of Governors. While they have only one vote, the Chair

controls the agenda, and is the Fed's public voice, so they have more power and influence than one might

expect.

banks, each of which is responsible for supporting the commercial banks and economy generally in its district.

Figure 15.3 shows the Federal Reserve districts and the cities where their regional headquarters are located.

The commercial banks in each district elect a Board of Directors for each regional Federal Reserve bank, and

that board chooses a president for each regional Federal Reserve district. Thus, the Federal Reserve System

includes both federally and private-sector appointed leaders.

FIGURE 15.3 The Twelve Federal Reserve Districts There are twelve regional Federal Reserve banks, each with its

district.

What Does a Central Bank Do?

The Federal Reserve, like most central banks, is designed to perform three important functions:

1. To conduct monetary policy

2. To promote stability of the financial system

3. To provide banking services to commercial banks and other depository institutions, and to provide

banking services to the federal government.

The first two functions are sufficiently important that we will discuss them in their own modules. The third

function we will discuss here.

The Federal Reserve provides many of the same services to banks as banks provide to their customers. For

example, all commercial banks have an account at the Fed where they deposit reserves. Similarly, banks can

obtain loans from the Fed through the “discount window” facility, which we will discuss in more detail later.

The Fed is also responsible for check processing. When you write a check, for example, to buy groceries, the

grocery store deposits the check in its bank account. Then, the grocery store's bank returns the physical check

(or an image of that actual check) to your bank, after which it transfers funds from your bank account to the
grocery store's account. The Fed is responsible for each of these actions.

On a more mundane level, the Federal Reserve ensures that enough currency and coins are circulating

through the financial system to meet public demands. For example, each year the Fed increases the amount of

currency available in banks around the Christmas shopping season and reduces it again in January.

Finally, the Fed is responsible for assuring that banks are in compliance with a wide variety of consumer

protection laws. For example, banks are forbidden from discriminating on the basis of age, race, sex, or marital

status. Banks are also required to disclose publicly information about the loans they make for buying houses

and how they distribute the loans geographically, as well as by sex and race of the loan applicants.

15.2 • Bank Regulation 361

15.2 Bank Regulation

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Discuss the relationship between bank regulation and monetary policy

• Explain bank supervision

• Explain how deposit insurance and lender of last resort are two strategies to protect against bank runs

A safe and stable national financial system is a critical concern of the Federal Reserve. The goal is not only to

protect individuals’ savings, but to protect the integrity of the financial system itself. This esoteric task is

usually behind the scenes, but came into view during the 2008–2009 financial crisis, when for a brief period of

time, critical parts of the financial system failed and firms became unable to obtain financing for ordinary

parts of their business. Imagine if suddenly you were unable to access the money in your bank accounts

because your checks were not accepted for payment and your debit cards were declined. This gives an idea of a

failure of the payments/financial system.

Bank regulation is intended to maintain banks' solvency by avoiding excessive risk. Regulation falls into a

number of categories, including reserve requirements, capital requirements, and restrictions on the types of

investments banks may make. In Money and Banking, we learned that banks are required to hold a minimum

percentage of their deposits on hand as reserves. “On hand” is a bit of a misnomer because, while a portion of

bank reserves are held as cash in the bank, the majority are held in the bank’s account at the Federal Reserve,

and their purpose is to cover desired withdrawals by depositors. Another part of bank regulation is restrictions

on the types of investments banks are allowed to make. Banks are permitted to make loans to businesses,

individuals, and other banks. They can purchase U.S. Treasury securities but, to protect depositors, they are

not permitted to invest in the stock market or other assets that are perceived as too risky.

Bank capital is the difference between a bank’s assets and its liabilities. In other words, it is a bank’s net worth.

A bank must have positive net worth; otherwise it is insolvent or bankrupt, meaning it would not have enough

assets to pay back its liabilities. Regulation requires that banks maintain a minimum net worth, usually

expressed as a percent of their assets, to protect their depositors and other creditors.

Policy and Bank Regulation.”

Bank Supervision

Several government agencies monitor banks' balance sheets to make sure they have positive net worth and are

not taking too high a level of risk. Within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Office of the Comptroller of

the Currency has a national staff of bank examiners who conduct on-site reviews of the 1,500 or so of the

largest national banks. The bank examiners also review any foreign banks that have branches in the United

States. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency also monitors and regulates about 800 savings and loan

institutions.

The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) supervises credit unions, which are nonprofit banks that

their members run and own. There are about 5,000 credit unions in the U.S. economy today, although the

typical credit union is small compared to most banks.

The Federal Reserve also has some responsibility for supervising financial institutions. For example, we call

conglomerate firms that own banks and other businesses “bank holding companies.” While other regulators

like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency supervises the banks, the Federal Reserve supervises the

holding companies.

362 15 • Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation

When bank supervision (and bank-like institutions such as savings and loans and credit unions) works well,

most banks will remain financially healthy most of the time. If the bank supervisors find that a bank has low or

negative net worth, or is making too high a proportion of risky loans, they can require that the bank change its

behavior—or, in extreme cases, even force the bank to close or be sold to a financially healthy bank.

Bank supervision can run into both practical and political questions. The practical question is that measuring

the value of a bank’s assets is not always straightforward. As we discussed in Money and Banking, a bank’s

assets are its loans, and the value of these assets depends on estimates about the risk that customers will not

repay these loans. These issues can become even more complex when a bank makes loans to banks or firms in

other countries, or arranges financial deals that are much more complex than a basic loan.

The political question arises because a bank supervisor's decision to require a bank to close or to change its

financial investments is often controversial, and the bank supervisor often comes under political pressure

from the bank's owners and the local politicians to keep quiet and back off.

For example, many observers have pointed out that Japan’s banks were in deep financial trouble through most

of the 1990s; however, nothing substantial had been done about it by the early 2000s. A similar unwillingness

to confront problems with struggling banks is visible across the rest of the world, in East Asia, Latin America,

Eastern Europe, Russia, and elsewhere.

In the United States, the government passed laws in the 1990s requiring that bank supervisors make their

findings open and public, and that they act as soon as they identify a problem. However, as many U.S. banks

were staggered by the 2008-2009 recession, critics of the bank regulators asked pointed questions about why

the regulators had not foreseen the banks' financial shakiness earlier, before such large losses had a chance to

accumulate.

Bank Runs

Back in the nineteenth century and during the first few decades of the twentieth century (around and during

the Great Depression), putting your money in a bank could be nerve-wracking. Imagine that the net worth of

your bank became negative, so that the bank’s assets were not enough to cover its liabilities. In this situation,

whoever withdrew their deposits first received all of their money, and those who did not rush to the bank

quickly enough, lost their money. We call depositors racing to the bank to withdraw their deposits, as Figure

15.4 shows a bank run. In the movie It’s a Wonderful Life, the bank manager, played by Jimmy Stewart, faces a

mob of worried bank depositors who want to withdraw their money, but manages to allay their fears by

allowing some of them to withdraw a portion of their deposits—using the money from his own pocket that was

supposed to pay for his honeymoon.

situation. (Credit: “Depression: "Runs on Banks” by National Archives and Records Administration, Public Domain)

The risk of bank runs created instability in the banking system. Even a rumor that a bank might experience

negative net worth could trigger a bank run and, in a bank run, even healthy banks could be destroyed.

Because a bank loans out most of the money it receives, and because it keeps only limited reserves on hand, a

bank run of any size would quickly drain any of the bank’s available cash. When the bank had no cash

remaining, it only intensified the fears of remaining depositors that they could lose their money. Moreover, a

bank run at one bank often triggered a chain reaction of runs on other banks. In the late nineteenth and early

twentieth century, bank runs were typically not the original cause of a recession—but they could make a

recession much worse.

Deposit Insurance

To protect against bank runs, Congress has put two strategies into place: deposit insurance and the lender of

last resort. Deposit insurance is an insurance system that makes sure depositors in a bank do not lose their

money, even if the bank goes bankrupt. About 70 countries around the world, including all of the major

economies, have deposit insurance programs. In the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

(FDIC) is responsible for deposit insurance. Banks pay an insurance premium to the FDIC. The insurance

premium is based on the bank’s level of deposits, and then adjusted according to the riskiness of a bank’s

financial situation. In 2009, for example, a fairly safe bank with a high net worth might have paid 10–20 cents

in insurance premiums for every $100 in bank deposits, while a risky bank with very low net worth might have

paid 50–60 cents for every $100 in bank deposits.

Bank examiners from the FDIC evaluate the banks' balance sheets, looking at the asset and liability values to

determine the risk level. The FDIC provides deposit insurance for about 4,914 banks (as of the third quarter of

2021). Even if a bank fails, the government guarantees that depositors will receive up to $250,000 of their

money in each account, which is enough for almost all individuals, although not sufficient for many

businesses. Since the United States enacted deposit insurance in the 1930s, no one has lost any of their

insured deposits. Bank runs no longer happen at insured banks.

Lender of Last Resort

The problem with bank runs is not that insolvent banks will fail; they are, after all, bankrupt and need to be

shut down. The problem is that bank runs can cause solvent banks to fail and spread to the rest of the financial

system. To prevent this, the Fed stands ready to lend to banks and other financial institutions when they

cannot obtain funds from anywhere else. This is known as the lender of last resort role. For banks, the central

bank acting as a lender of last resort helps to reinforce the effect of deposit insurance and to reassure bank

customers that they will not lose their money.

The lender of last resort task can arise in other financial crises, as well. During the 1987 stock market crash

panic, when U.S. stock values fell by 25% in a single day, the Federal Reserve made a number of short-term

emergency loans so that the financial system could keep functioning. During the 2008-2009 recession, we can

interpret the Fed's “quantitative easing” policies (discussed below) as a willingness to make short-term credit

available as needed in a time when the banking and financial system was under stress.

•

Interpret and show bank activity through balance sheets

The Federal Reserve's most important function is to conduct the nation’s monetary policy. Article I, Section 8

of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power “to coin money” and “to regulate the value thereof.” As part of

364 15 • Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation

the 1913 legislation that created the Federal Reserve, Congress delegated these powers to the Fed. Monetary

policy involves managing interest rates and credit conditions, which influences the level of economic activity,

as we describe in more detail below.

A central bank has three traditional tools to implement monetary policy in the economy:

• Open market operations

• Changing reserve requirements

• Changing the discount rate

In discussing how these three tools work, it is useful to think of the central bank as a “bank for banks”—that is,

each private-sector bank has its own account at the central bank. We will discuss each of these monetary

policy tools in the sections below.

Open Market Operations

Since the early 1920s, the most common monetary policy tool in the U.S. has been open market operations.

These take place when the central bank sells or buys U.S. Treasury bonds in order to influence the quantity of

bank reserves and the level of interest rates. The specific interest rate targeted in open market operations is

the federal funds rate. The name is a bit of a misnomer since the federal funds rate is the interest rate that

commercial banks charge making overnight loans to other banks. As such, it is a very short term interest rate,

but one that reflects credit conditions in financial markets very well.

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) makes the decisions regarding these open market operations.

The FOMC comprises seven members of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. It also includes five voting

members who the Board draws, on a rotating basis, from the regional Federal Reserve Banks. The New York

district president is a permanent FOMC voting member and the Board fills other four spots on a rotating,

annual basis, from the other 11 districts. The FOMC typically meets every six weeks, but it can meet more

frequently if necessary. The FOMC tries to act by consensus; however, the Federal Reserve's chairman has

traditionally played a very powerful role in defining and shaping that consensus. For the Federal Reserve, and

for most central banks, open market operations have, over the last few decades, been the most commonly used

tool of monetary policy.

monetary policy.

To understand how open market operations affect the money supply, consider the balance sheet of Happy

Bank, displayed in Figure 15.5. Figure 15.5 (a) shows that Happy Bank starts with $460 million in assets,

divided among reserves, bonds and loans, and $400 million in liabilities in the form of deposits, with a net

worth of $60 million. When the central bank purchases $20 million in bonds from Happy Bank, the bond

holdings of Happy Bank fall by $20 million and the bank’s reserves rise by $20 million, as Figure 15.5 (b)

shows. However, Happy Bank only wants to hold $40 million in reserves (the quantity of reserves with which it

started in Figure 15.5) (a), so the bank decides to loan out the extra $20 million in reserves and its loans rise by

$20 million, as Figure 15.5(c) shows. The central bank's open market operation causes Happy Bank to make

loans instead of holding its assets in the form of government bonds, which expands the money supply. As the

new loans are deposited in banks throughout the economy, these banks will, in turn, loan out some of the

deposits they receive, triggering the money multiplier that we discussed in Money and Banking.

15.3 • How a Central Bank Executes Monetary Policy 365

FIGURE 15.5

Where did the Federal Reserve get the $20 million that it used to purchase the bonds? A central bank has the

power to create money. In practical terms, the Federal Reserve would write a check to Happy Bank, so that

Happy Bank can have that money credited to its bank account at the Federal Reserve. In truth, the Federal

Reserve created the money to purchase the bonds out of thin air—or with a few clicks on some computer keys.

Open market operations can also reduce the quantity of money and loans in an economy. Figure 15.6 (a) shows

the balance sheet of Happy Bank before the central bank sells bonds in the open market. When Happy Bank

purchases $30 million in bonds, Happy Bank sends $30 million of its reserves to the central bank, but now

holds an additional $30 million in bonds, as Figure 15.6 (b) shows. However, Happy Bank wants to hold $40

million in reserves, as in Figure 15.6 (a), so it will adjust down the quantity of its loans by $30 million, to bring

its reserves back to the desired level, as Figure 15.6 (c) shows. In practical terms, a bank can easily reduce its

quantity of loans. At any given time, a bank is receiving payments on loans that it made previously and also

making new loans. If the bank just slows down or briefly halts making new loans, and instead adds those funds

to its reserves, then its overall quantity of loans will decrease. A decrease in the quantity of loans also means

fewer deposits in other banks, and other banks reducing their lending as well, as the money multiplier that we

discussed in Money and Banking takes effect. What about all those bonds? How do they affect the money

supply? Read the following Clear It Up feature for the answer.

366 15 • Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation

FIGURE 15.6

CLEAR IT UP

Does selling or buying bonds increase the money supply?
Is it a sale of bonds by the central bank which increases bank reserves and lowers interest rates or is it a purchase

of bonds by the central bank? The easy way to keep track of this is to treat the central bank as being outsidethe

banking system. When a central bank buys bonds, money is flowing from the central bank to individual banks in the

economy, increasing the money supply in circulation. When a central bank sells bonds, then money from individual

banks in the economy is flowing into the central bank—reducing the quantity of money in the economy.

The Federal Reserve was founded in the aftermath of the 1907 Financial Panic when many banks failed as a

result of bank runs. As mentioned earlier, since banks make profits by lending out their deposits, no bank,

even those that are not bankrupt, can withstand a bank run. As a result of the Panic, the Federal Reserve was

founded to be the “lender of last resort.” In the event of a bank run, sound banks, (banks that were not

bankrupt) could borrow as much cash as they needed from the Fed’s discount “window” to quell the bank run.

We call the interest rate banks pay for such loans the discount rate. (They are so named because the bank

makes loans against its outstanding loans “at a discount” of their face value.) Once depositors became

convinced that the bank would be able to honor their withdrawals, they no longer had a reason to make a run

on the bank. In short, the Federal Reserve was originally intended to provide credit passively, but in the years

since its founding, the Fed has taken on a more active role with monetary policy.

The second traditional method for conducting monetary policy is to raise or lower the discount rate. If the

central bank raises the discount rate, then commercial banks will reduce their borrowing of reserves from the

Fed, and instead call in loans to replace those reserves. Since fewer loans are available, the money supply falls

and market interest rates rise. If the central bank lowers the discount rate it charges to banks, the process

works in reverse.

In recent decades, the Federal Reserve has made relatively few discount loans. Before a bank borrows from the

Federal Reserve to fill out its required reserves, the bank is expected to first borrow from other available

sources, like other banks. This is encouraged by the Fed charging a higher discount rate than the federal funds

rate. Given that most banks borrow little at the discount rate, changing the discount rate up or down has little

15.4 • Monetary Policy and Economic Outcomes 367

impact on their behavior. More importantly, the Fed has found from experience that open market operations

are a more precise and powerful means of executing any desired monetary policy.

Changing Reserve Requirements

A potential third method of conducting monetary policy is for the central bank to raise or lower the reserve

requirement, which, as we noted earlier, is the percentage of each bank’s deposits that it is legally required to

hold either as cash in their vault or on deposit with the central bank. If banks are required to hold a greater

amount in reserves, they have less money available to lend out. If banks are allowed to hold a smaller amount

in reserves, they will have a greater amount of money available to lend out.

Until very recently, the Federal Reserve required banks to hold reserves equal to 0% of the first $14.5 million

in deposits, then to hold reserves equal to 3% of the deposits up to $103.6 million, and 10% of any amount

above $103.6 million. The Fed makes small changes in the reserve requirements almost every year. For

example, the $103.6 million dividing line is sometimes bumped up or down by a few million dollars. Today,

these rates are no longer in effect; as of March 2020 (when the pandemic-induced recession hit), the 10% and

3% requirements were reduced to 0%, effectively eliminating the reserve requirement for all depository

institutions.

The Fed rarely uses large changes in reserve requirements to execute monetary policy; the pandemic was an

exception for obvious reasons. Also, a sudden demand that all banks increase their reserves would be

extremely disruptive and difficult for them to comply. While loosening requirements too much might create a

danger of banks’ inability to meet withdrawal demands, the benefits of reducing the reserve requirements in

March 2020 exceeded the risks.

Changing the Discount Rate

In the Federal Reserve Act, the phrase “...to afford means of rediscounting commercial paper” is contained in

its long title. This was the main tool for monetary policy when the Fed was initially created. Today, the Federal

Reserve has even more tools at its disposal, including quantitative easing, overnight repurchase agreements,

and interest on excess reserves. This illustrates how monetary policy has evolved and how it continues to do

so.

15.4 Monetary Policy and Economic Outcomes

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Contrast expansionary monetary policy and contractionary monetary policy

• Explain how monetary policy impacts interest rates and aggregate demand

• Evaluate Federal Reserve decisions over the last forty years

• Explain the significance of quantitative easing (QE)

A monetary policy that lowers interest rates and stimulates borrowing is an expansionary monetary policy or

loose monetary policy. Conversely, a monetary policy that raises interest rates and reduces borrowing in the

economy is a contractionary monetary policy or tight monetary policy. This module will discuss how

expansionary and contractionary monetary policies affect interest rates and aggregate demand, and how such

policies will affect macroeconomic goals like unemployment and inflation. We will conclude with a look at the

368 15 • Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation

Fed’s monetary policy practice in recent decades.

The Effect of Monetary Policy on Interest Rates

Consider the market for loanable bank funds in Figure 15.7. The original equilibrium (E0) occurs at an 8%
interest rate and a quantity of funds loaned and borrowed of $10 billion. An expansionary monetary policy will
shift the supply of loanable funds to the right from the original supply curve (S0) to S1, leading to an
equilibrium (E1) with a lower 6% interest rate and a quantity $14 billion in loaned funds. Conversely, a
contractionary monetary policy will shift the supply of loanable funds to the left from the original supply curve
(S0) to S2, leading to an equilibrium (E2) with a higher 10% interest rate and a quantity of $8 billion in loaned
funds.

FIGURE 15.7 Monetary Policy and Interest Rates The original equilibrium occurs at E0. An expansionary monetary
policy will shift the supply of loanable funds to the right from the original supply curve (S0) to the new supply curve
(S1) and to a new equilibrium of E1, reducing the interest rate from 8% to 6%. A contractionary monetary policy will
shift the supply of loanable funds to the left from the original supply curve (S0) to the new supply (S2), and raise the
interest rate from 8% to 10%.

How does a central bank “raise” interest rates? When describing the central bank's monetary policy actions, it

is common to hear that the central bank “raised interest rates” or “lowered interest rates.” We need to be clear

about this: more precisely, through open market operations the central bank changes bank reserves in a way

which affects the supply curve of loanable funds. As a result, Figure 15.7 shows that interest rates change. If

they do not meet the Fed’s target, the Fed can supply more or less reserves until interest rates do.

Recall that the specific interest rate the Fed targets is the federal funds rate. The Federal Reserve has, since

1995, established its target federal funds rate in advance of any open market operations.

Of course, financial markets display a wide range of interest rates, representing borrowers with different risk

premiums and loans that they must repay over different periods of time. In general, when the federal funds

rate drops substantially, other interest rates drop, too, and when the federal funds rate rises, other interest

rates rise. However, a fall or rise of one percentage point in the federal funds rate—which remember is for

borrowing overnight—will typically have an effect of less than one percentage point on a 30-year loan to

purchase a house or a three-year loan to purchase a car. Monetary policy can push the entire spectrum of

interest rates higher or lower, but the forces of supply and demand in those specific markets for lending and

borrowing set the specific interest rates.

The Effect of Monetary Policy on Aggregate Demand

Monetary policy affects interest rates and the available quantity of loanable funds, which in turn affects several

components of aggregate demand. Tight or contractionary monetary policy that leads to higher interest rates

Access for free at openstax.org

15.4 • Monetary Policy and Economic Outcomes 369

and a reduced quantity of loanable funds will reduce two components of aggregate demand. Business

investment will decline because it is less attractive for firms to borrow money, and even firms that have money

will notice that, with higher interest rates, it is relatively more attractive to put those funds in a financial

investment than to make an investment in physical capital. In addition, higher interest rates will discourage

consumer borrowing for big-ticket items like houses and cars. Conversely, loose or expansionary monetary

policy that leads to lower interest rates and a higher quantity of loanable funds will tend to increase business

investment and consumer borrowing for big-ticket items.

If the economy is suffering a recession and high unemployment, with output below potential GDP,

expansionary monetary policy can help the economy return to potential GDP. Figure 15.8 (a) illustrates this

situation. This example uses a short-run upward-sloping Keynesian aggregate supply curve (SRAS). The
original equilibrium during a recession of E0 occurs at an output level of 600. An expansionary monetary
policy will reduce interest rates and stimulate investment and consumption spending, causing the original
aggregate demand curve (AD0) to shift right to AD1, so that the new equilibrium (E1) occurs at the potential GDP
level of 700.

FIGURE 15.8 Expansionary or Contractionary Monetary Policy (a) The economy is originally in a recession with the
equilibrium output and price shown at E0. Expansionary monetary policy will reduce interest rates and shift
aggregate demand to the right from AD0 to AD1, leading to the new equilibrium (E1) at the potential GDP level of
output with a relatively small rise in the price level. (b) The economy is originally producing above the potential GDP
level of output at the equilibrium E0 and is experiencing pressures for an inflationary rise in the price level.
Contractionary monetary policy will shift aggregate demand to the left from AD0 to AD1, thus leading to a new
equilibrium (E1) at the potential GDP level of output.

Conversely, if an economy is producing at a quantity of output above its potential GDP, a contractionary

monetary policy can reduce the inflationary pressures for a rising price level. In Figure 15.8 (b), the original
equilibrium (E0) occurs at an output of 750, which is above potential GDP. A contractionary monetary policy
will raise interest rates, discourage borrowing for investment and consumption spending, and cause the
original demand curve (AD0) to shift left to AD1, so that the new equilibrium (E1) occurs at the potential GDP
level of 700.

These examples suggest that monetary policy should be countercyclical; that is, it should act to

counterbalance the business cycles of economic downturns and upswings. The Fed should loosen monetary

policy when a recession has caused unemployment to increase and tighten it when inflation threatens. Of

course, countercyclical policy does pose a danger of overreaction. If loose monetary policy seeking to end a

recession goes too far, it may push aggregate demand so far to the right that it triggers inflation. If tight

370 15 • Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation

monetary policy seeking to reduce inflation goes too far, it may push aggregate demand so far to the left that a

recession begins. Figure 15.9 (a) summarizes the chain of effects that connect loose and tight monetary policy

to changes in output and the price level.

FIGURE 15.9 The Pathways of Monetary Policy (a) In expansionary monetary policy the central bank causes the

supply of money and loanable funds to increase, which lowers the interest rate, stimulating additional borrowing for

investment and consumption, and shifting aggregate demand right. The result is a higher price level and, at least in

the short run, higher real GDP. (b) In contractionary monetary policy, the central bank causes the supply of money

and credit in the economy to decrease, which raises the interest rate, discouraging borrowing for investment and

consumption, and shifting aggregate demand left. The result is a lower price level and, at least in the short run,

lower real GDP.

Federal Reserve Actions Over Last Four Decades

For the period from 1970 through 2020, we can summarize Federal Reserve monetary policy by looking at how

it targeted the federal funds interest rate using open market operations.

Of course, telling the story of the U.S. economy since 1970 in terms of Federal Reserve actions leaves out many

other macroeconomic factors that were influencing unemployment, recession, economic growth, and inflation

over this time. The ten episodes of Federal Reserve action outlined in the sections below also demonstrate that

we should consider the central bank as one of the leading actors influencing the macro economy. As we noted

earlier, the single person with the greatest power to influence the U.S. economy is probably the Federal Reserve

chairperson.

Figure 15.10 shows how the Federal Reserve has carried out monetary policy by targeting the federal funds

interest rate in the last few decades. The graph shows the federal funds interest rate (remember, this interest

rate is set through open market operations), the unemployment rate, and the inflation rate since 1970.

Different episodes of monetary policy during this period are indicated in the figure.

15.4 • Monetary Policy and Economic Outcomes 371

FIGURE 15.10 Monetary Policy, Unemployment, and Inflation Through the episodes here, the Federal Reserve

typically reacted to higher inflation with a contractionary monetary policy and a higher interest rate, and reacted to

higher unemployment with an expansionary monetary policy and a lower interest rate.

Episode 1

Consider Episode 1 in the late 1970s. The rate of inflation was very high, exceeding 10% in 1979 and 1980, so

the Federal Reserve used tight monetary policy to raise interest rates, with the federal funds rate rising from

5.5% in 1977 to 16.4% in 1981. By 1983, inflation was down to 3.2%, but aggregate demand contracted sharply

enough that back-to-back recessions occurred in 1980 and in 1981–1982, and the unemployment rate rose

from 5.8% in 1979 to 9.7% in 1982.

Episode 2

In Episode 2, when economists persuaded the Federal Reserve in the early 1980s that inflation was declining,

the Fed began slashing interest rates to reduce unemployment. The federal funds interest rate fell from 16.4%

in 1981 to 6.8% in 1986. By 1986 or so, inflation had fallen to about 2% and the unemployment rate had come

down to 7%, and was still falling.

Episode 3

However, in Episode 3 in the late 1980s, inflation appeared to be creeping up again, rising from 2% in 1986 up

toward 5% by 1989. In response, the Federal Reserve used contractionary monetary policy to raise the federal

funds rates from 6.6% in 1987 to 9.2% in 1989. The tighter monetary policy stopped inflation, which fell from

above 5% in 1990 to under 3% in 1992, but it also helped to cause the 1990-1991 recession, and the

unemployment rate rose from 5.3% in 1989 to 7.5% by 1992.

Episode 4

In Episode 4, in the early 1990s, when the Federal Reserve was confident that inflation was back under control,

it reduced interest rates, with the federal funds interest rate falling from 8.1% in 1990 to 3.5% in 1992. As the

economy expanded, the unemployment rate declined from 7.5% in 1992 to less than 5% by 1997.

Episodes 5 and 6

In Episodes 5 and 6, the Federal Reserve perceived a risk of inflation and raised the federal funds rate from 3%

to 5.8% from 1993 to 1995. Inflation did not rise, and the period of economic growth during the 1990s

continued. Then in 1999 and 2000, the Fed was concerned that inflation seemed to be creeping up so it raised

the federal funds interest rate from 4.6% in December 1998 to 6.5% in June 2000. By early 2001, inflation was

declining again, but a recession occurred in 2001. Between 2000 and 2002, the unemployment rate rose from

372 15 • Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation

4.0% to 5.8%.

Episodes 7 and 8

In Episodes 7 and 8, the Federal Reserve conducted a loose monetary policy and slashed the federal funds rate

from 6.2% in 2000 to just 1.7% in 2002, and then again to 1% in 2003. They actually did this because of fear of

Japan-style deflation. This persuaded them to lower the Fed funds further than they otherwise would have. The

recession ended, but, unemployment rates were slow to decline in the early 2000s. Finally, in 2004, the

unemployment rate declined and the Federal Reserve began to raise the federal funds rate until it reached 5%

by 2007.

Episode 9

In Episode 9, as the Great Recession took hold in 2008, the Federal Reserve was quick to slash interest rates,

taking them down to 2% in 2008 and to nearly 0% in 2009. When the Fed had taken interest rates down to

near-zero, the economy was still deep in recession. Open market operations could not make the interest rate

turn negative. The Federal Reserve had to think “outside the box.”

Episode 10

In Episode 10, which started in March 2020, the Fed cut interest rates again, reducing the target federal funds

rate from 2% to between 0–1/4% in a matter of weeks. Limited by the zero lower bound, the Fed once again had

to think “outside the box” in order to further support the financial system.

Quantitative Easing

The most powerful and commonly used of the three traditional tools of monetary policy—open market

operations—works by expanding or contracting the money supply in a way that influences the interest rate. In

late 2008, as the U.S. economy struggled with recession, the Federal Reserve had already reduced the interest

rate to near-zero. With the recession still ongoing, the Fed decided to adopt an innovative and nontraditional

policy known as quantitative easing (QE). This is the purchase of long-term government and private

mortgage-backed securities by central banks to make credit available so as to stimulate aggregate demand.

Quantitative easing differed from traditional monetary policy in several key ways. First, it involved the Fed

purchasing long term Treasury bonds, rather than short term Treasury bills. In 2008, however, it was

impossible to stimulate the economy any further by lowering short term rates because they were already as

low as they could get. (Read the closing Bring it Home feature for more on this.) Therefore, Chairman Bernanke

sought to lower long-term rates utilizing quantitative easing.

This leads to a second way QE is different from traditional monetary policy. Instead of purchasing Treasury

securities, the Fed also began purchasing private mortgage-backed securities, something it had never done
before. During the financial crisis, which precipitated the recession, mortgage-backed securities were termed

“toxic assets,” because when the housing market collapsed, no one knew what these securities were worth,

which put the financial institutions which were holding those securities on very shaky ground. By offering to

purchase mortgage-backed securities, the Fed was both pushing long term interest rates down and also

removing possibly “toxic assets” from the balance sheets of private financial firms, which would strengthen

the financial system.

Quantitative easing (QE) occurred in three episodes:

1. During QE1, which began in November 2008, the Fed purchased $600 billion in mortgage-backed

securities from government enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
In November 2010, the Fed began QE2, in which it purchased $600 billion in U.S. Treasury bonds.

2.
3. QE3, began in September 2012 when the Fed commenced purchasing $40 billion of additional mortgage-

backed securities per month. This amount was increased in December 2012 to $85 billion per month. The

Fed stated that, when economic conditions permit, it will begin tapering (or reducing the monthly

purchases). By October 2014, the Fed had announced the final $15 billion bond purchase, ending

Quantitative Easing.

We usually think of the quantitative easing policies that the Federal Reserve adopted (as did other central

banks around the world) as temporary emergency measures. If these steps are to be temporary, then the

Federal Reserve will need to stop making these additional loans and sell off the financial securities it has

accumulated. The concern is that the process of quantitative easing may prove more difficult to reverse than it
was to enact. The evidence suggests that QE1 was somewhat successful, but that QE2 and QE3 have been less
so.

Fast forward to March 2020, when the Fed under the leadership of Jerome Powell promised another round of

asset purchases which was dubbed by some as “QE4,” intended once again to provide liquidity to a distressed

financial system in the wake of the pandemic. This round was much faster, increasing Fed assets by $2 trillion

in just a few months. Recently, the Fed has begun to slow down the purchase of these assets once again through

a taper, and the pace of the tapering is expected to increase through 2022. But as of the end of 2021, total Fed

assets exceed $8 trillion, compared to $4 trillion in February 2020.

15.5 Pitfalls for Monetary Policy

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Analyze whether monetary policy decisions should be made more democratically

• Calculate the velocity of money

• Evaluate the central bank’s influence on inflation, unemployment, asset bubbles, and leverage cycles

• Calculate the effects of monetary stimulus

In the real world, effective monetary policy faces a number of significant hurdles. Monetary policy affects the

economy only after a time lag that is typically long and of variable length. Remember, monetary policy involves

a chain of events: the central bank must perceive a situation in the economy, hold a meeting, and make a

decision to react by tightening or loosening monetary policy. The change in monetary policy must percolate

through the banking system, changing the quantity of loans and affecting interest rates. When interest rates

change, businesses must change their investment levels and consumers must change their borrowing patterns

when purchasing homes or cars. Then it takes time for these changes to filter through the rest of the economy.

As a result of this chain of events, monetary policy has little effect in the immediate future. Instead, its primary

effects are felt perhaps one to three years in the future. The reality of long and variable time lags does not

mean that a central bank should refuse to make decisions. It does mean that central banks should be humble

about taking action, because of the risk that their actions can create as much or more economic instability as

they resolve.

Excess Reserves

Banks are legally required to hold a minimum level of reserves, but no rule prohibits them from holding

additional excess reserves above the legally mandated limit. For example, during a recession banks may be

hesitant to lend, because they fear that when the economy is contracting, a high proportion of loan applicants

become less likely to repay their loans.

When many banks are choosing to hold excess reserves, expansionary monetary policy may not work well.

This may occur because the banks are concerned about a deteriorating economy, while the central bank is

trying to expand the money supply. If the banks prefer to hold excess reserves above the legally required level,

the central bank cannot force individual banks to make loans. Similarly, sensible businesses and consumers

may be reluctant to borrow substantial amounts of money in a recession, because they recognize that firms’

sales and employees’ jobs are more insecure in a recession, and they do not want to face the need to make

interest payments. The result is that during an especially deep recession, an expansionary monetary policy

374 15 • Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation

may have little effect on either the price level or the real GDP.

Japan experienced this situation in the 1990s and early 2000s. Japan’s economy entered a period of very slow

growth, dipping in and out of recession, in the early 1990s. By February 1999, the Bank of Japan had lowered

the equivalent of its federal funds rate to 0%. It kept it there most of the time through 2003. Moreover, in the

two years from March 2001 to March 2003, the Bank of Japan also expanded the country's money supply by

about 50%—an enormous increase. Even this highly expansionary monetary policy, however, had no

substantial effect on stimulating aggregate demand. Japan’s economy continued to experience extremely slow

growth into the mid-2000s.

CLEAR IT UP

Should monetary policy decisions be made more democratically?
Should a nation’s Congress or legislature comprised of elected representatives conduct monetary policy or should a

politically appointed central bank that is more independent of voters take charge? Here are some of the arguments.

The Case for Greater Democratic Control of Monetary Policy

Elected representatives pass taxes and spending bills to conduct fiscal policy by passing tax and spending bills.

They could handle monetary policy in the same way. They will sometimes make mistakes, but in a democracy, it is

better to have elected officials who are accountable to voters make mistakes instead of political appointees. After

all, the people appointed to the top governing positions at the Federal Reserve—and to most central banks around

the world—are typically bankers and economists. They are not representatives of borrowers like small businesses or

farmers nor are they representatives of labor unions. Central banks might not be so quick to raise interest rates if

they had to pay more attention to firms and people in the real economy.

The Case for an Independent Central Bank

Because the central bank has some insulation from day-to-day politics, its members can take a nonpartisan look at

specific economic situations and make tough, immediate decisions when necessary. The idea of giving a legislature

the ability to create money and hand out loans is likely to end up badly, sooner or later. It is simply too tempting for

lawmakers to expand the money supply to fund their projects. The long term result will be rampant inflation. Also, a

central bank, acting according to the laws passed by elected officials, can respond far more quickly than a

legislature. For example, the U.S. budget takes months to debate, pass, and sign into law, but monetary policy

decisions happen much more rapidly. Day-to-day democratic control of monetary policy is impractical and seems

likely to lead to an overly expansionary monetary policy and higher inflation.

The problem of excess reserves does not affect contractionary policy. Central bankers have an old saying that

monetary policy can be like pulling and pushing on a string: when the central bank pulls on the string and uses

contractionary monetary policy, it can definitely raise interest rates and reduce aggregate demand. However,

when the central bank tries to push on the string of expansionary monetary policy, the string may sometimes

just fold up limp and have little effect, because banks decide not to loan out their excess reserves. Do not take

this analogy too literally—expansionary monetary policy usually does have real effects, after that

inconveniently long and variable lag. There are also times, like Japan’s economy in the late 1990s and early

2000s, when expansionary monetary policy has been insufficient to lift a recession-prone economy.

Unpredictable Movements of Velocity

Velocity is a term that economists use to describe how quickly money circulates through the economy. We

define the velocity of money in a year as:

Specific measurements of velocity depend on the definition of the money supply used. Consider the velocity of

Access for free at openstax.org

15.5 • Pitfalls for Monetary Policy 375

M1, the total amount of currency in circulation and checking account balances. In 2009, for example, M1 was

$1.7 trillion and nominal GDP was $14.3 trillion, so the velocity of M1 was 8.4 (which is $14.3 trillion/$1.7

trillion). A higher velocity of money means that the average dollar circulates more times in a year. A lower

velocity means that the average dollar circulates fewer times in a year.

See the following Clear It Up feature for a discussion of how deflation could affect monetary policy.

CLEAR IT UP

What happens during episodes of deflation?
Deflation occurs when the rate of inflation is negative; that is, instead of money having less purchasing power over

time, as occurs with inflation, money is worth more. Deflation can make it very difficult for monetary policy to

address a recession.

Remember that the real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation. If the nominal interest

rate is 7% and the rate of inflation is 3%, then the borrower is effectively paying a 4% real interest rate. If the

nominal interest rate is 7% and there is deflationof 2%, then the real interest rate is actually 9%. In this way, an

unexpected deflation raises the real interest payments for borrowers. It can lead to a situation where borrowers do
not repay an unexpectedly high number of loans, and banks find that their net worth is decreasing or negative. When

banks are suffering losses, they become less able and eager to make new loans. Aggregate demand declines, which

can lead to recession.

Then the double-whammy: After causing a recession, deflation can make it difficult for monetary policy to work. Say

that the central bank uses expansionary monetary policy to reduce the nominal interest rate all the way to zero—but

the economy has 5% deflation. As a result, the real interest rate is 5%, and because a central bank cannot make the

nominal interest rate negative, expansionary policy cannot reduce the real interest rate further.

In the U.S. economy during the early 1930s, deflation was 6.7% per year from 1930–1933, which caused many

borrowers to default on their loans and many banks to end up bankrupt, which in turn contributed substantially to

the Great Depression. Not all episodes of deflation, however, end in economic depression. Japan, for example,

experienced deflation of slightly less than 1% per year from 1999–2002, which hurt the Japanese economy, but it

still grew by about 0.9% per year over this period. There is at least one historical example of deflation coexisting

with rapid growth. The U.S. economy experienced deflation of about 1.1% per year over the quarter-century from

1876–1900, but real GDP also expanded at a rapid clip of 4% per year over this time, despite some occasional

severe recessions.

The central bank should be on guard against deflation and, if necessary, use expansionary monetary policy to

prevent any long-lasting or extreme deflation from occurring. Except in severe cases like the Great Depression,
deflation does not guarantee economic disaster.

Changes in velocity can cause problems for monetary policy. To understand why, rewrite the definition of

velocity so that the money supply is on the left-hand side of the equation. That is:

Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that

Therefore,

We sometimes call this equation the basic quantity equation of money but, as you can see, it is just the

definition of velocity written in a different form. This equation must hold true, by definition.

376 15 • Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation

If velocity is constant over time, then a certain percentage rise in the money supply on the left-hand side of the

basic quantity equation of money will inevitably lead to the same percentage rise in nominal GDP—although

this change could happen through an increase in inflation, or an increase in real GDP, or some combination of

the two. If velocity is changing over time but in a constant and predictable way, then changes in the money

supply will continue to have a predictable effect on nominal GDP. If velocity changes unpredictably over time,

however, then the effect of changes in the money supply on nominal GDP becomes unpredictable.

Figure 15.11 illustrates the actual velocity of money in the U.S. economy as measured by using M1, the most

common definition of the money supply. From 1960 up to about 1980, velocity appears fairly predictable; that

is, it is increasing at a fairly constant rate. In the early 1980s, however, velocity as calculated with M1 becomes

more variable. The reasons for these sharp changes in velocity remain a puzzle. Economists suspect that the

changes in velocity are related to innovations in banking and finance which have changed how we are using

money in making economic transactions: for example, the growth of electronic payments; a rise in personal

borrowing and credit card usage; and accounts that make it easier for people to hold money in savings

accounts, where it is counted as M2, right up to the moment that they want to write a check on the money and

transfer it to M1. So far at least, it has proven difficult to draw clear links between these kinds of factors and the

specific up-and-down fluctuations in M1. Given many changes in banking and the prevalence of electronic

banking, economists now favor M2 as a measure of money rather than the narrower M1.

FIGURE 15.11 Velocity Calculated Using M1 Velocity is the nominal GDP divided by the money supply for a given

year. We can calculate different measures of velocity by using different measures of the money supply. Velocity, as

calculated by using M1, has lacked a steady trend since the 1980s, instead bouncing up and down. Note also that

the redefinition of M1 to include savings deposits in 2020 (see Money and Banking) drastically increased M1 in

2020, causing velocity to plummet. (credit: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)

monetary-policy)

Velocity Calculated Using M1

In the 1970s, when velocity as measured by M1 seemed predictable, a number of economists, led by Nobel

laureate Milton Friedman (1912–2006), argued that the best monetary policy was for the central bank to

increase the money supply at a constant growth rate. These economists argued that with the long and variable

lags of monetary policy, and the political pressures on central bankers, central bank monetary policies were as

likely to have undesirable as to have desirable effects. Thus, these economists believed that the monetary

policy should seek steady growth in the money supply of 3% per year. They argued that a steady monetary

growth rate would be correct over longer time periods, since it would roughly match the growth of the real

economy. In addition, they argued that giving the central bank less discretion to conduct monetary policy

would prevent an overly activist central bank from becoming a source of economic instability and uncertainty.

In this spirit, Friedman wrote in 1967: “The first and most important lesson that history teaches about what

Access for free at openstax.org

15.5 • Pitfalls for Monetary Policy 377

monetary policy can do—and it is a lesson of the most profound importance—is that monetary policy can

prevent money itself from being a major source of economic disturbance.”

As the velocity of M1 began to fluctuate in the 1980s, having the money supply grow at a predetermined and

unchanging rate seemed less desirable, because as the quantity theory of money shows, the combination of

constant growth in the money supply and fluctuating velocity would cause nominal GDP to rise and fall in

unpredictable ways. The jumpiness of velocity in the 1980s caused many central banks to focus less on the

rate at which the quantity of money in the economy was increasing, and instead to set monetary policy by

reacting to whether the economy was experiencing or in danger of higher inflation or unemployment.

Unemployment and Inflation

If you were to survey central bankers around the world and ask them what they believe should be the primary

task of monetary policy, the most popular answer by far would be fighting inflation. Most central bankers

believe that the neoclassical model of economics accurately represents the economy over the medium to long

term. Remember that in the neoclassical model of the economy, we draw the aggregate supply curve as a

vertical line at the level of potential GDP, as Figure 15.12 shows. In the neoclassical model, economists

determine the level of potential GDP (and the natural rate of unemployment that exists when the economy is
producing at potential GDP) by real economic factors. If the original level of aggregate demand is AD0, then an
expansionary monetary policy that shifts aggregate demand to AD1 only creates an inflationary increase in the
price level, but it does not alter GDP or unemployment. From this perspective, all that monetary policy can do

is to lead to low inflation or high inflation—and low inflation provides a better climate for a healthy and growing

economy. After all, low inflation means that businesses making investments can focus on real economic

issues, not on figuring out ways to protect themselves from the costs and risks of inflation. In this way, a

consistent pattern of low inflation can contribute to long-term growth.

FIGURE 15.12 Monetary Policy in a Neoclassical Model In a neoclassical view, monetary policy affects only the

price level, not the level of output in the economy. For example, an expansionary monetary policy causes aggregate
demand to shift from the original AD0 to AD1. However, the adjustment of the economy from the original equilibrium
(E0) to the new equilibrium (E1) represents an inflationary increase in the price level from P0 to P1, but has no effect
in the long run on output or the unemployment rate. In fact, no shift in AD will affect the equilibrium quantity of

output in this model.

This vision of focusing monetary policy on a low rate of inflation is so attractive that many countries have

rewritten their central banking laws since in the 1990s to have their bank practice inflation targeting, which

means that the central bank is legally required to focus primarily on keeping inflation low. By 2014, central

banks in 28 countries, including Austria, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden,

Thailand, and the United Kingdom faced a legal requirement to target the inflation rate. A notable exception is

the Federal Reserve in the United States, which does not practice inflation-targeting. Instead, the law

governing the Federal Reserve requires it to take both unemployment and inflation into account.

378 15 • Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation

Economists have no final consensus on whether a central bank should be required to focus only on inflation or

should have greater discretion. For those who subscribe to the inflation targeting philosophy, the fear is that

politicians who are worried about slow economic growth and unemployment will constantly pressure the

central bank to conduct a loose monetary policy—even if the economy is already producing at potential GDP. In

some countries, the central bank may lack the political power to resist such pressures, with the result of higher

inflation, but no long-term reduction in unemployment. The U.S. Federal Reserve has a tradition of

independence, but central banks in other countries may be under greater political pressure. For all of these

reasons—long and variable lags, excess reserves, unstable velocity, and controversy over economic

goals—monetary policy in the real world is often difficult. The basic message remains, however, that central

banks can affect aggregate demand through the conduct of monetary policy and in that way influence

macroeconomic outcomes.

Asset Bubbles and Leverage Cycles

One long-standing concern about having the central bank focus on inflation and unemployment is that it may

be overlooking certain other economic problems that are coming in the future. For example, from 1994 to

2000 during what was known as the “dot-com” boom, the U.S. stock market, which the Dow Jones Industrial
Index measures (which includes 30 very large companies from across the U.S. economy), nearly tripled in
value. The Nasdaq index, which includes many smaller technology companies, increased in value by a

multiple of five from 1994 to 2000. These rates of increase were clearly not sustainable. Stock values as

measured by the Dow Jones were almost 20% lower in 2009 than they had been in 2000. Stock values in the

Nasdaq index were 50% lower in 2009 than they had been in 2000. The drop-off in stock market values

contributed to the 2001 recession and the higher unemployment that followed.

We can tell a similar story about housing prices in the mid-2000s. During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s,

housing prices increased at about 6% per year on average. During what came to be known as the “housing

bubble” from 2003 to 2005, housing prices increased at almost double this annual rate. These rates of increase

were clearly not sustainable. When housing prices fell in 2007 and 2008, many banks and households found

that their assets were worth less than they expected, which contributed to the recession that started in 2007.

At a broader level, some economists worry about a leverage cycle, where “leverage” is a term financial

economists use to mean “borrowing.” When economic times are good, banks and the financial sector are eager

to lend, and people and firms are eager to borrow. Remember that a money multiplier determines the amount

of money and credit in an economy —a process of loans made, money deposited, and more loans made. In good

economic times, this surge of lending exaggerates the episode of economic growth. It can even be part of what

lead prices of certain assets—like stock prices or housing prices—to rise at unsustainably high annual rates. At

some point, when economic times turn bad, banks and the financial sector become much less willing to lend,

and credit becomes expensive or unavailable to many potential borrowers. The sharp reduction in credit,

perhaps combined with the deflating prices of a dot-com stock price bubble or a housing bubble, makes the

economic downturn worse than it would otherwise be.

Thus, some economists have suggested that the central bank should not just look at economic growth,

inflation, and unemployment rates, but should also keep an eye on asset prices and leverage cycles. Such

proposals are quite controversial. If a central bank had announced in 1997 that stock prices were rising “too

fast” or in 2004 that housing prices were rising “too fast,” and then taken action to hold down price increases,

many people and their elected political representatives would have been outraged. Neither the Federal

Reserve nor any other central banks want to take the responsibility of deciding when stock prices and housing

prices are too high, too low, or just right. As further research explores how asset price bubbles and leverage

cycles can affect an economy, central banks may need to think about whether they should conduct monetary

policy in a way that would seek to moderate these effects.

Let’s end this chapter with a Work it Out exercise in how the Fed—or any central bank—would stir up the

economy by increasing the money supply.

WORK IT OUT

Calculating the Effects of Monetary Stimulus
Suppose that the central bank wants to stimulate the economy by increasing the money supply. The bankers

estimate that the velocity of money is 3, and that the price level will increase from 100 to 110 due to the

stimulus. Using the quantity equation of money, what will be the impact of an $800 billion dollar increase in the

money supply on the quantity of goods and services in the economy given an initial money supply of $4 trillion?

Step 1. We begin by writing the quantity equation of money: MV = PQ. We know that initially V = 3, M = 4,000

(billion) and P = 100. Substituting these numbers in, we can solve for Q:

Step 2. Now we want to find the effect of the addition $800 billion in the money supply, together with the

increase in the price level. The new equation is:

Step 3. If we take the difference between the two quantities, we find that the monetary stimulus increased the

quantity of goods and services in the economy by 10.9 billion.

The discussion in this chapter has focused on domestic monetary policy; that is, the view of monetary policy

within an economy. Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows explores the international dimension of

monetary policy, and how monetary policy becomes involved with exchange rates and international flows of

financial capital.

BRING IT HOME

The Problem of the Zero Percent Interest Rate Lower Bound
In 2008, the U.S. Federal Reserve found itself in a difficult position. The federal funds rate was on its way to near

zero, which meant that traditional open market operations, by which the Fed purchases U.S. Treasury Bills to lower

short term interest rates, was no longer viable. This so called “zero bound problem,” prompted the Fed, under then
Chair Ben Bernanke, to attempt some unconventional policies, collectively called quantitative easing. By early 2014,

quantitative easing nearly quintupled the amount of bank reserves. This likely contributed to the U.S. economy’s

recovery, but the impact was muted, probably due to some of the hurdles mentioned in the last section of this

module. The unprecedented increase in bank reserves also led to fears of inflation, which never bore out.

Throughout the 2010s there have been no serious signs of inflation with core inflation around a stable 1.5–2%. As of

early 2015, however, there have been no serious signs of a boom, with core inflation around a stable 1.7%.

The Zero Lower Bound was encountered again in 2020 due to the pandemic, when the target federal funds rate

dropped by over two percentage points in a matter of weeks. The Fed further responded by increasing asset

purchases by an even greater amount, and at a faster rate, than in 2009. When the U.S. started experiencing higher-

than-average inflation in 2021, the Fed chair Jerome Powell responded to criticisms by saying that the Fed was

poised to consider rate increases and start tapering the rate of asset purchases into 2022. It remains to be seen

whether inflation can be tamed moving forward, or if more aggressive policy measures will be required.

Key Concepts and Summary

15.1 The Federal Reserve Banking System and Central Banks

The most prominent task of a central bank is to conduct monetary policy, which involves changes to interest

rates and credit conditions, affecting the amount of borrowing and spending in an economy. Some prominent

central banks around the world include the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of

Japan, and the Bank of England.

15.2 Bank Regulation

A bank run occurs when there are rumors (possibly true, possibly false) that a bank is at financial risk of

having negative net worth. As a result, depositors rush to the bank to withdraw their money and put it

someplace safer. Even false rumors, if they cause a bank run, can force a healthy bank to lose its deposits and

be forced to close. Deposit insurance guarantees bank depositors that, even if the bank has negative net worth,

their deposits will be protected. In the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) collects

deposit insurance premiums from banks and guarantees bank deposits up to $250,000. Bank supervision

involves inspecting the balance sheets of banks to make sure that they have positive net worth and that their

assets are not too risky. In the United States, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is responsible

for supervising banks and inspecting savings and loans and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)

is responsible for inspecting credit unions. The FDIC and the Federal Reserve also play a role in bank

supervision.

financial panic or stress. The failure of a single bank can be treated like any other business failure. Yet if many

banks fail, it can reduce aggregate demand in a way that can bring on or deepen a recession. The combination

of deposit insurance, bank supervision, and lender of last resort policies help to prevent weaknesses in the

banking system from causing recessions.

15.3 How a Central Bank Executes Monetary Policy

A central bank has three traditional tools to conduct monetary policy: open market operations, which involves

buying and selling government bonds with banks; reserve requirements, which determine what level of

reserves a bank is legally required to hold; and discount rates, which is the interest rate charged by the central

bank on the loans that it gives to other commercial banks. The most commonly used tool is open market

operations.

15.4 Monetary Policy and Economic Outcomes

An expansionary (or loose) monetary policy raises the quantity of money and credit above what it otherwise

would have been and reduces interest rates, boosting aggregate demand, and thus countering recession. A

contractionary monetary policy, also called a tight monetary policy, reduces the quantity of money and credit

below what it otherwise would have been and raises interest rates, seeking to hold down inflation. During the
2008–2009 recession, central banks around the world also used quantitative easing to expand the supply of

credit.

15.5 Pitfalls for Monetary Policy

Monetary policy is inevitably imprecise, for a number of reasons: (a) the effects occur only after long and

variable lags; (b) if banks decide to hold excess reserves, monetary policy cannot force them to lend; and (c)

velocity may shift in unpredictable ways. The basic quantity equation of money is MV = PQ, where M is the

money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the real output of the economy. Some

central banks, like the European Central Bank, practice inflation targeting, which means that the only goal of

the central bank is to keep inflation within a low target range. Other central banks, such as the U.S. Federal

Reserve, are free to focus on either reducing inflation or stimulating an economy that is in recession,

whichever goal seems most important at the time.

• Exchange Rate Policies

Introduction to Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows

BRING IT HOME

Is a Stronger Dollar Good for the U.S. Economy?
From 2002 to 2008, the U.S. dollar lost more than a quarter of its value in foreign currency markets. On January 1,

2002, one dollar was worth 1.11 euros. On April 24, 2008 it hit its lowest point with a dollar being worth 0.64 euros.

During this period, the trade deficit between the United States and the European Union grew from a yearly total of

approximately 85.7 billion dollars in 2002 to 95.8 billion dollars in 2008. Was this a good thing or a bad thing for the

U.S. economy?

We live in a global world. U.S. consumers buy trillions of dollars worth of imported goods and services each year, not

just from the European Union, but from all over the world. U.S. businesses sell trillions of dollars’ worth of exports.

U.S. citizens, businesses, and governments invest trillions of dollars abroad every year. Foreign investors,

386 16 • Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows

businesses, and governments invest trillions of dollars in the United States each year. Indeed, foreigners are a major

buyer of U.S. federal debt.

Many people feel that a weaker dollar is bad for America, that it’s an indication of a weak economy, but is it? This

chapter will help answer that question.

The world has over 150 different currencies, from the Afghanistan afghani and the Albanian lek all the way

through the alphabet to the Zambian kwacha and the Zimbabwean dollar. For international economic

transactions, households or firms will wish to exchange one currency for another. Perhaps the need for

exchanging currencies will come from a German firm that exports products to Russia, but then wishes to

exchange the Russian rubles it has earned for euros, so that the firm can pay its workers and suppliers in

Germany. Perhaps it will be a South African firm that wishes to purchase a mining operation in Angola, but to

make the purchase it must convert South African rand to Angolan kwanza. Perhaps it will be an American

tourist visiting China, who wishes to convert U.S. dollars to Chinese yuan to pay the hotel bill.

Exchange rates can sometimes change very swiftly. For example, in the United Kingdom the pound was worth

about $1.50 just before the nation voted to leave the European Union (also known as the Brexit vote), in June

2016; the pound fell to $1.37 just after the vote and continued falling to reach 30-year lows a few months later.

For firms engaged in international buying, selling, lending, and borrowing, these swings in exchange rates can

have an enormous effect on profits.

This chapter discusses the international dimension of money, which involves conversions from one currency

to another at an exchange rate. An exchange rate is nothing more than a price—that is, the price of one

currency in terms of another currency—and so we can analyze it with the tools of supply and demand. The first

module of this chapter begins with an overview of foreign exchange markets: their size, their main

participants, and the vocabulary for discussing movements of exchange rates. The following module uses

demand and supply graphs to analyze some of the main factors that cause shifts in exchange rates. A final

module then brings the central bank and monetary policy back into the picture. Each country must decide

whether to allow the market to determine its exchange rate, or have the central bank intervene. All the choices

for exchange rate policy involve distinctive tradeoffs and risks.

16.1 How the Foreign Exchange Market Works

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Define "foreign exchange market"

• Describe different types of investments like foreign direct investments (FDI), portfolio investments, and

hedging

• Explain how appreciating or depreciating currency affects exchange rates

•

Identify who benefits from a stronger currency and benefits from a weaker currency

Most countries have different currencies, but not all. Sometimes small economies use an economically larger

neighbor's currency. For example, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Panama have decided to dollarize—that is, to use

the U.S. dollar as their currency. Sometimes nations share a common currency. A large-scale example of a

common currency is the decision by 17 European nations—including some very large economies such as

France, Germany, and Italy—to replace their former currencies with the euro at the start of 1999. With these

exceptions, most of the international economy takes place in a situation of multiple national currencies in

which both people and firms need to convert from one currency to another when selling, buying, hiring,

borrowing, traveling, or investing across national borders. We call the market in which people or firms use one

currency to purchase another currency the foreign exchange market.

You have encountered the basic concept of exchange rates in earlier chapters. In The International Trade and

Capital Flows, for example, we discussed how economists use exchange rates to compare GDP statistics from

16.1 • How the Foreign Exchange Market Works 387

countries where they measure GDP in different currencies. These earlier examples, however, took the actual

exchange rate as given, as if it were a fact of nature. In reality, the exchange rate is a price—the price of one

currency expressed in terms of units of another currency. The key framework for analyzing prices, whether in

this course, any other economics course, in public policy, or business examples, is the operation of supply and

demand in markets.

The Extraordinary Size of the Foreign Exchange Markets

If you travel to a foreign country that uses a different currency, you will undoubtedly need to make a trip to a

bank or foreign currency office to exchange whatever currency you’re holding for that country’s currency. Even

though this is a simple transaction, it is part of a very large market. The quantities traded in foreign exchange

markets are breathtaking. A 2019 Bank of International Settlements survey found that $5.3 trillion per daywas

traded on foreign exchange markets, which makes the foreign exchange market the largest market in the world

economy. In contrast, 2019 U.S. real GDP was $21.4 trillion per year.

Your transaction is simple enough. Suppose you carry a $100 bill. You bring it into the foreign currency office

and look up, and you see a bunch of different numbers on a digital board. For example, if you are traveling to

Turkey, whose national currency is the Turkish Lira, one line of the board might read: “U.S. DOLLARS: BUY

5.50; SELL 5.80.” This means that the office will give you 5.50 Turkish Lira in exchange for 1 U.S. dollar. If you

have $100, the office will give you 550 Turkish Lira. If you want to sellTurkish Lira for U.S. dollars, the office

will surely buy them from you, but not at the same exchange rate, since the office will make some money on the

exchange. So if you bring 550 Turkish Lira and ask for U.S. dollars, it will not give you 100 dollars, but instead

about $95. The important point is that this one transaction, when repeated all over the world for all sorts of

different transactions, ends up totaling $6.6 trillion worth of exchanges per day.

Table 16.1 shows the currencies most commonly traded on foreign exchange markets. The U.S. dollar

dominates the foreign exchange market, being on one side of 88.3% of all foreign exchange transactions. The

U.S. dollar is followed by the euro, the British pound, the Australian dollar, and the Japanese yen.

Demanders and Suppliers of Currency in Foreign Exchange Markets

In foreign exchange markets, demand and supply become closely interrelated, because a person or firm who

demands one currency must at the same time supply another currency—and vice versa. To get a sense of this,

it is useful to consider four groups of people or firms who participate in the market: (1) firms that are involved

in international trade of goods and services; (2) tourists visiting other countries; (3) international investors

buying ownership (or part-ownership) of a foreign firm; (4) international investors making financial

investments that do not involve ownership. Let’s consider these categories in turn.

Firms that buy and sell on international markets find that their costs for workers, suppliers, and investors are

measured in the currency of the nation where their production occurs, but their revenues from sales are

measured in the currency of the different nation where their sales happened. Thus, a Chinese firm exporting

abroad will earn some other currency—say, U.S. dollars—but will need Chinese yuan to pay the workers,

suppliers, and investors who are based in China. In the foreign exchange markets, this firm will be a supplier of

U.S. dollars and a demander of Chinese yuan.

International tourists will supply their home currency to receive the currency of the country they are visiting.

For example, an American tourist who is visiting China will supply U.S. dollars into the foreign exchange

market and demand Chinese yuan.

We often divide financial investments that cross international boundaries, and require exchanging currency
into two categories. Foreign direct investment (FDI) refers to purchasing a firm (at least ten percent) in

another country or starting up a new enterprise in a foreign country For example, in 2008 the Belgian beer-

brewing company InBev bought the U.S. beer-maker Anheuser-Busch for $52 billion. To make this purchase,

InBev would have to supply euros (the currency of Belgium) to the foreign exchange market and demand U.S.

dollars.

The other kind of international financial investment, portfolio investment, involves a purely financial

investment that does not entail any management responsibility. An example would be a U.S. financial investor

who purchased U.K. government bonds, or deposited money in a British bank. To make such investments, the

American investor would supply U.S. dollars in the foreign exchange market and demand British pounds.

Business people often link portfolio investment to expectations about how exchange rates will shift. Look at a

U.S. financial investor who is considering purchasing U.K. issued bonds. For simplicity, ignore any bond

interest payment (which will be small in the short run anyway) and focus on exchange rates. Say that a British

pound is currently worth $1.50 in U.S. currency. However, the investor believes that in a month, the British

Access for free at openstax.org

16.1 • How the Foreign Exchange Market Works 389

pound will be worth $1.60 in U.S. currency. Thus, as Figure 16.2 (a) shows, this investor would change $24,000

for 16,000 British pounds. In a month, if the pound is worth $1.60, then the portfolio investor can trade back to

U.S. dollars at the new exchange rate, and have $25,600—a nice profit. A portfolio investor who believes that

the foreign exchange rate for the pound will work in the opposite direction can also invest accordingly. Say that

an investor expects that the pound, now worth $1.50 in U.S. currency, will decline to $1.40. Then, as Figure

16.2 (b) shows, that investor could start off with £20,000 in British currency (borrowing the money if

necessary), convert it to $30,000 in U.S. currency, wait a month, and then convert back to approximately

£21,429 in British currency—again making a nice profit. Of course, this kind of investing comes without

guarantees, and an investor will suffer losses if the exchange rates do not move as predicted.

FIGURE 16.2 A Portfolio Investor Trying to Benefit from Exchange Rate Movements Expectations of a currency's

future value can drive its demand and supply in foreign exchange markets.

Many portfolio investment decisions are not as simple as betting that the currency's value will change in one

direction or the other. Instead, they involve firms trying to protect themselves from movements in exchange

rates. Imagine you are running a U.S. firm that is exporting to France. You have signed a contract to deliver

certain products and will receive 1 million euros a year from now. However, you do not know how much this

contract will be worth in U.S. dollars, because the dollar/euro exchange rate can fluctuate in the next year. Let’s

say you want to know for sure what the contract will be worth, and not take a risk that the euro will be worth

less in U.S. dollars than it currently is. You can hedge, which means using a financial transaction to protect

yourself against a risk from one of your investments (in this case, currency risk from the contract). Specifically,

you can sign a financial contract and pay a fee that guarantees you a certain exchange rate one year from

now—regardless of what the market exchange rate is at that time. Now, it is possible that the euro will be worth

more in dollars a year from now, so your hedging contract will be unnecessary, and you will have paid a fee for

nothing. However, if the value of the euro in dollars declines, then you are protected by the hedge. When

parties wish to enter financial contracts like hedging, they normally rely on a financial institution or brokerage

company to handle the hedging. These companies either take a fee or create a spread in the exchange rate in

order to earn money through the service they provide.

Both foreign direct investment and portfolio investment involve an investor who supplies domestic currency

and demands a foreign currency. With portfolio investment, the client purchases less than ten percent of a

company. As such, business players often get involved with portfolio investment with a short term focus. With

foreign direct investment the investor purchases more than ten percent of a company and the investor

390 16 • Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows

typically assumes some managerial responsibility. Thus, foreign direct investment tends to have a more long-

run focus. As a practical matter, an investor can withdraw portfolio investments from a country much more

quickly than foreign direct investments. A U.S. portfolio investor who wants to buy or sell U.K. government

bonds can do so with a phone call or a few computer keyboard clicks. However, a U.S. firm that wants to buy or

sell a company, such as one that manufactures automobile parts in the United Kingdom, will find that planning

and carrying out the transaction takes a few weeks, even months. Table 16.2 summarizes the main categories

of currency demanders and suppliers.

TABLE 16.2 The Demand and Supply Line-ups in Foreign Exchange Markets

Participants in the Exchange Rate Market

The foreign exchange market does not involve the ultimate suppliers and demanders of foreign exchange

literally seeking each other. If Martina decides to leave her home in Venezuela and take a trip in the United

States, she does not need to find a U.S. citizen who is planning to take a vacation in Venezuela and arrange a

person-to-person currency trade. Instead, the foreign exchange market works through financial institutions,

and it operates on several levels.

Most people and firms who are exchanging a substantial quantity of currency go to a bank, and most banks

provide foreign exchange as a service to customers. These banks (and a few other firms), known as dealers,

then trade the foreign exchange. This is called the interbank market.

In the world economy, roughly 2,000 firms are foreign exchange dealers. The U.S. economy has less than 100

foreign exchange dealers, but the largest 12 or so dealers carry out more than half the total transactions. The
foreign exchange market has no central location, but the major dealers keep a close watch on each other at all

times.

The foreign exchange market is huge not because of the demands of tourists, firms, or even foreign direct

investment, but instead because of portfolio investment and the actions of interlocking foreign exchange

dealers. International tourism is a very large industry, involving about $1 trillion per year. Global exports are

about 23.5% of global GDP or about $19 trillion per year. Foreign direct investment totaled about $870 billion

in the end of 2021. These quantities are dwarfed, however, by the $6.6 trillion per daytraded in foreign

exchange markets. Most transactions in the foreign exchange market are for portfolio investment—relatively

short-term movements of financial capital between currencies—and because of the large foreign exchange
dealers' actions as they constantly buy and sell with each other.

Strengthening and Weakening Currency

When the prices of most goods and services change, the price "rises or "falls". For exchange rates, the

terminology is different. When the exchange rate for a currency rises, so that the currency exchanges for more

16.1 • How the Foreign Exchange Market Works 391

of other currencies, we refer to it as appreciating or “strengthening.” When the exchange rate for a currency

falls, so that a currency trades for less of other currencies, we refer to it as depreciating or “weakening.”

To illustrate the use of these terms, consider the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar

since 1980, in Figure 16.3 (a). The vertical axis in Figure 16.3 (a) shows the price of $1 in U.S. currency,

measured in terms of Canadian currency. Clearly, exchange rates can move up and down substantially. A U.S.

dollar traded for $1.17 Canadian in 1980. The U.S. dollar appreciated or strengthened to $1.39 Canadian in

1986, depreciated or weakened to $1.15 Canadian in 1991, and then appreciated or strengthened to $1.60

Canadian by early in 2002, fell to roughly $1.20 Canadian in 2009, and then had a sharp spike up and decline

in 2009 and 2010. In August 2022, the U.S. dollar stood at $1.28 Canadian. The units in which we measure

exchange rates can be confusing, because we measure the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar exchange using a

different currency—the Canadian dollar. However, exchange rates always measure the price of one unit of

currency by using a different currency.

FIGURE 16.3 Strengthen or Appreciate vs. Weaken or Depreciate Exchange rates tend to fluctuate substantially,

even between bordering companies such as the United States and Canada. By looking closely at the time values (the

years vary slightly on these graphs), it is clear that the values in part (a) are a mirror image of part (b), which

demonstrates that the depreciation of one currency correlates to the appreciation of the other and vice versa. This

means that when comparing the exchange rates between two countries (in this case, the United States and Canada),

the depreciation (or weakening) of one country (the U.S. dollar for this example) indicates the appreciation (or

392 16 • Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows

strengthening) of the other currency (which in this example is the Canadian dollar). (Source: Federal Reserve

Economic Data (FRED) https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/EXCAUS)

In looking at the exchange rate between two currencies, the appreciation or strengthening of one currency

must mean the depreciation or weakening of the other. Figure 16.3 (b) shows the exchange rate for the

Canadian dollar, measured in terms of U.S. dollars. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar measured in Canadian

dollars, in Figure 16.3 (a), is a perfect mirror image with the Canadian dollar exchange rate measured in U.S.

dollars, in Figure 16.3 (b). A fall in the Canada $/U.S. $ ratio means a rise in the U.S. $/Canada $ ratio, and vice

versa.

foreign-exchange-market-works)

Canadian Dollars per 1 U.S. Dollar.

With the price of a typical good or service, it is clear that higher prices benefit sellers and hurt buyers, while

lower prices benefit buyers and hurt sellers. In the case of exchange rates, where the buyers and sellers are not

always intuitively obvious, it is useful to trace how a stronger or weaker currency will affect different market

participants. Consider, for example, the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on six different groups of economic

actors, as Figure 16.4 shows: (1) U.S. exporters selling abroad; (2) foreign exporters (that is, firms selling

imports in the U.S. economy); (3) U.S. tourists abroad; (4) foreign tourists visiting the United States; (5) U.S.

investors (either foreign direct investment or portfolio investment) considering opportunities in other

countries; (6) and foreign investors considering opportunities in the U.S. economy.

FIGURE 16.4 How Do Exchange Rate Movements Affect Each Group? Exchange rate movements affect exporters,

tourists, and international investors in different ways.

For a U.S. firm selling abroad, a stronger U.S. dollar is a curse. A strong U.S. dollar means that foreign

currencies are correspondingly weak. When this exporting firm earns foreign currencies through its export

sales, and then converts them back to U.S. dollars to pay workers, suppliers, and investors, the stronger dollar

means that the foreign currency buys fewer U.S. dollars than if the currency had not strengthened, and that the

firm’s profits (as measured in dollars) fall. As a result, the firm may choose to reduce its exports, or it may raise

its selling price, which will also tend to reduce its exports. In this way, a stronger currency reduces a country’s

exports.

Conversely, for a foreign firm selling in the U.S. economy, a stronger dollar is a blessing. Each dollar earned

through export sales, when traded back into the exporting firm's home currency, will now buy more home

currency than expected before the dollar had strengthened. As a result, the stronger dollar means that the

Access for free at openstax.org

16.1 • How the Foreign Exchange Market Works 393

importing firm will earn higher profits than expected. The firm will seek to expand its sales in the U.S.

economy, or it may reduce prices, which will also lead to expanded sales. In this way, a stronger U.S. dollar

means that consumers will purchase more from foreign producers, expanding the country’s level of imports.

For a U.S. tourist abroad, who is exchanging U.S. dollars for foreign currency as necessary, a stronger U.S.

dollar is a benefit. The tourist receives more foreign currency for each U.S. dollar, and consequently the cost of

the trip in U.S. dollars is lower. When a country’s currency is strong, it is a good time for citizens of that country

to tour abroad. Imagine a U.S. tourist who has saved up $5,000 for a trip to South Africa. In February 2018, $1

bought 11.9 South African rand, so the tourist had 59,500 rand to spend. By 2018, $1 bought 14.5 rand, which

for the tourist translates to 72,500 rand. For foreign visitors to the United States, the opposite pattern holds

true. A relatively stronger U.S. dollar means that their own currencies are relatively weaker, so that as they shift

from their own currency to U.S. dollars, they have fewer U.S. dollars than previously. When a country’s

currency is strong, it is not an especially good time for foreign tourists to visit.

A stronger dollar injures the prospects of a U.S. financial investor who has already invested money in another

country. A U.S. financial investor abroad must first convert U.S. dollars to a foreign currency, invest in a foreign

country, and then later convert that foreign currency back to U.S. dollars. If in the meantime the U.S. dollar
becomes stronger and the foreign currency becomes weaker, then when the investor converts back to U.S.
dollars, the rate of return on that investment will be less than originally expected at the time it was made.

However, a stronger U.S. dollar boosts the returns of a foreign investor putting money into a U.S. investment.

That foreign investor converts from the home currency to U.S. dollars and seeks a U.S. investment, while later

planning to switch back to the home currency. If, in the meantime, the dollar grows stronger, then when the

time comes to convert from U.S. dollars back to the foreign currency, the investor will receive more foreign

currency than expected at the time the original investment was made.

The preceding paragraphs all focus on the case where the U.S. dollar becomes stronger. The first column in

Figure 16.4 illustrates the corresponding happy or unhappy economic reactions. The following Work It Out

feature centers the analysis on the opposite: a weaker dollar.

WORK IT OUT

Effects of a Weaker Dollar
Let’s work through the effects of a weaker dollar on a U.S. exporter, a foreign exporter into the United States, a

U.S. tourist going abroad, a foreign tourist coming to the United States, a U.S. investor abroad, and a foreign

investor in the United States.

Step 1. Note that the demand for U.S. exports is a function of the price of those exports, which depends on the
dollar price of those goods and the exchange rate of the dollar in terms of foreign currency. For example, a Ford

pickup truck costs $25,000 in the United States. When it is sold in the United Kingdom, the price is $25,000 /

$1.30 per British pound, or £19,231. The dollar affects the price foreigners face who may purchase U.S. exports.

Step 2. Consider that, if the dollar weakens, the pound rises in value. If the pound rises to $2.00 per pound, then

the price of a Ford pickup is now $25,000 / $2.00 = £12,500. A weaker dollar means the foreign currency buys

more dollars, which means that U.S. exports appear less expensive.

Step 3. Summarize that a weaker U.S. dollar leads to an increase in U.S. exports. For a foreign exporter, the

outcome is just the opposite.

Step 4. Suppose a brewery in England is interested in selling its Bass Ale to a grocery store in the United States.

If the price of a six pack of Bass Ale is £6.00 and the exchange rate is $1.30 per British pound, the price for the

grocery store is 6.00 × $1.30 = $7.80 per six pack. If the dollar weakens to $2.00 per pound, the price of Bass

Ale is now 6.00 × $2.00 = $12.

394 16 • Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows

Step 5. Summarize that, from the perspective of U.S. purchasers, a weaker dollar means that foreign currency is

more expensive, which means that foreign goods are more expensive also. This leads to a decrease in U.S.

imports, which is bad for the foreign exporter.

Step 6. Consider U.S. tourists going abroad. They face the same situation as a U.S. importer—they are purchasing

a foreign trip. A weaker dollar means that their trip will cost more, since a given expenditure of foreign currency

(e.g., hotel bill) will take more dollars. The result is that the tourist may not stay as long abroad, and some may

choose not to travel at all.

Step 7. Consider that, for the foreign tourist to the United States, a weaker dollar is a boon. It means their

currency goes further, so the cost of a trip to the United States will be less. Foreigners may choose to take longer

trips to the United States, and more foreign tourists may decide to take U.S. trips.

Step 8. Note that a U.S. investor abroad faces the same situation as a U.S. importer—they are purchasing a

foreign asset. A U.S. investor will see a weaker dollar as an increase in the “price” of investment, since the same

number of dollars will buy less foreign currency and thus less foreign assets. This should decrease the amount of

U.S. investment abroad.

Step 9. Note also that foreign investors in the Unites States will have the opposite experience. Since foreign

currency buys more dollars, they will likely invest in more U.S. assets.

At this point, you should have a good sense of the major players in the foreign exchange market: firms involved

in international trade, tourists, international financial investors, banks, and foreign exchange dealers. The next

module shows how players can use the tools of demand and supply in foreign exchange markets to explain the

underlying causes of stronger and weaker currencies (we address “stronger” and “weaker” more in the

following Clear It Up feature).

CLEAR IT UP

Why is a stronger currency not necessarily better?
One common misunderstanding about exchange rates is that a “stronger” or “appreciating” currency must be better

than a “weaker” or “depreciating” currency. After all, is it not obvious that “strong” is better than “weak”? Do not let

the terminology confuse you. When a currency becomes stronger, so that it purchases more of other currencies, it

benefits some in the economy and injures others. Stronger currency is not necessarily better, it is just different.

16.2 Demand and Supply Shifts in Foreign Exchange Markets

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain supply and demand for exchange rates

• Define arbitrage

• Explain purchasing power parity's importance when comparing countries.

The foreign exchange market involves firms, households, and investors who demand and supply currencies

coming together through their banks and the key foreign exchange dealers. Figure 16.5 (a) offers an example

for the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican peso. The vertical axis shows the exchange rate

for U.S. dollars, which in this case is measured in pesos. The horizontal axis shows the quantity of U.S. dollars

traded in the foreign exchange market each day. The demand curve (D) for U.S. dollars intersects with the

supply curve (S) of U.S. dollars at the equilibrium point (E), which is an exchange rate of 10 pesos per dollar

and a total volume of $8.5 billion.

FIGURE 16.5 Demand and Supply for the U.S. Dollar and Mexican Peso Exchange Rate (a) The quantity measured

on the horizontal axis is in U.S. dollars, and the exchange rate on the vertical axis is the price of U.S. dollars

measured in Mexican pesos. (b) The quantity measured on the horizontal axis is in Mexican pesos, while the price on

at point E, at the intersection of the demand curve (D) and the supply curve (S).

Figure 16.5 (b) presents the same demand and supply information from the perspective of the Mexican peso.

The vertical axis shows the exchange rate for Mexican pesos, which is measured in U.S. dollars. The horizontal

axis shows the quantity of Mexican pesos traded in the foreign exchange market. The demand curve (D) for

Mexican pesos intersects with the supply curve (S) of Mexican pesos at the equilibrium point (E), which is an

exchange rate of 10 cents in U.S. currency for each Mexican peso and a total volume of 85 billion pesos. Note

that the two exchange rates are inverses: 10 pesos per dollar is the same as 10 cents per peso (or $0.10 per

peso). In the actual foreign exchange market, almost all of the trading for Mexican pesos is for U.S. dollars.

What factors would cause the demand or supply to shift, thus leading to a change in the equilibrium exchange

rate? We discuss the answer to this question in the following section.

Expectations about Future Exchange Rates

One reason to demand a currency on the foreign exchange market is the belief that the currency's value is

about to increase. One reason to supply a currency—that is, sell it on the foreign exchange market—is the

expectation that the currency's value is about to decline. For example, imagine that a leading business

newspaper, like the Wall Street Journalor the Financial Times, runs an article predicting that the Mexican peso

will appreciate in value. Figure 16.6 illustrates the likely effects of such an article. Demand for the Mexican
peso shifts to the right, from D0 to D1, as investors become eager to purchase pesos. Conversely, the supply of
pesos shifts to the left, from S0 to S1, because investors will be less willing to give them up. The result is that the
equilibrium exchange rate rises from 10 cents/peso to 12 cents/peso and the equilibrium exchange rate rises
from 85 billion to 90 billion pesos as the equilibrium moves from E0 to E1.

396 16 • Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows

FIGURE 16.6 Exchange Rate Market for Mexican Peso Reacts to Expectations about Future Exchange Rates An

announcement that the peso exchange rate is likely to strengthen in the future will lead to greater demand for the

peso in the present from investors who wish to benefit from the appreciation. Similarly, it will make investors less

likely to supply pesos to the foreign exchange market. Both the shift of demand to the right and the shift of supply to

the left cause an immediate appreciation in the exchange rate.

Figure 16.6 also illustrates some peculiar traits of supply and demand diagrams in the foreign exchange

market. In contrast to all the other cases of supply and demand you have considered, in the foreign exchange

market, supply and demand typically both move at the same time. Groups of participants in the foreign

exchange market like firms and investors include some who are buyers and some who are sellers. An

expectation of a future shift in the exchange rate affects both buyers and sellers—that is, it affects both demand

and supply for a currency.

The shifts in demand and supply curves both cause the exchange rate to shift in the same direction. In this

example, they both make the peso exchange rate stronger. However, the shifts in demand and supply work in

opposing directions on the quantity traded. In this example, the rising demand for pesos is causing the

quantity to rise while the falling supply of pesos is causing quantity to fall. In this specific example, the result is

a higher quantity. However, in other cases, the result could be that quantity remains unchanged or declines.

This example also helps to explain why exchange rates often move quite substantially in a short period of a few

weeks or months. When investors expect a country’s currency to strengthen in the future, they buy the

currency and cause it to appreciate immediately. The currency's appreciation can lead other investors to

believe that future appreciation is likely—and thus lead to even further appreciation. Similarly, a fear that a

currency mightweaken quickly leads to an actualweakening of the currency, which often reinforces the belief

that the currency will weaken further. Thus, beliefs about the future path of exchange rates can be self-

reinforcing, at least for a time, and a large share of the trading in foreign exchange markets involves dealers

trying to outguess each other on what direction exchange rates will move next.

Differences across Countries in Rates of Return

The motivation for investment, whether domestic or foreign, is to earn a return. If rates of return in a country

look relatively high, then that country will tend to attract funds from abroad. Conversely, if rates of return in a

country look relatively low, then funds will tend to flee to other economies. Changes in the expected rate of

return will shift demand and supply for a currency. For example, imagine that interest rates rise in the United

States as compared with Mexico. Thus, financial investments in the United States promise a higher return than

previously. As a result, more investors will demand U.S. dollars so that they can buy interest-bearing assets

and fewer investors will be willing to supply U.S. dollars to foreign exchange markets. Demand for the U.S.
dollar will shift to the right, from D0 to D1, and supply will shift to the left, from S0 to S1, as Figure 16.7 shows.
The new equilibrium (E1), will occur at an exchange rate of nine pesos/dollar and the same quantity of $8.5
billion. Thus, a higher interest rate or rate of return relative to other countries leads a nation’s currency to

appreciate or strengthen, and a lower interest rate relative to other countries leads a nation’s currency to

16.2 • Demand and Supply Shifts in Foreign Exchange Markets 397

depreciate or weaken. Since a nation’s central bank can use monetary policy to affect its interest rates, a

central bank can also cause changes in exchange rates—a connection that we will discuss in more detail later

in this chapter.

FIGURE 16.7 Exchange Rate Market for U.S. Dollars Reacts to Higher Interest Rates A higher rate of return for U.S.

dollars makes holding dollars more attractive. Thus, the demand for dollars in the foreign exchange market shifts to
the right, from D0 to D1, while the supply of dollars shifts to the left, from S0 to S1. The new equilibrium (E1) has a
stronger exchange rate than the original equilibrium (E0), but in this example, the equilibrium quantity traded does
not change.

Relative Inflation

If a country experiences a relatively high inflation rate compared with other economies, then the buying power

of its currency is eroding, which will tend to discourage anyone from wanting to acquire or to hold the

currency. Figure 16.8 shows an example based on an actual episode concerning the Mexican peso. In 1986–87,

Mexico experienced an inflation rate of over 200%. Not surprisingly, as inflation dramatically decreased the

peso's purchasing power in Mexico. The peso's exchange rate value declined as well. Figure 16.8 shows that the
demand for the peso on foreign exchange markets decreased from D0 to D1, while the peso's supply increased
from S0 to S1. The equilibrium exchange rate fell from $2.50 per peso at the original equilibrium (E0) to $0.50
per peso at the new equilibrium (E1). In this example, the quantity of pesos traded on foreign exchange
markets remained the same, even as the exchange rate shifted.

FIGURE 16.8 Exchange Rate Markets React to Higher Inflation If a currency is experiencing relatively high inflation,

then its buying power is decreasing and international investors will be less eager to hold it. Thus, a rise in inflation in
the Mexican peso would lead demand to shift from D0 to D1, and supply to increase from S0 to S1. Both movements

398 16 • Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows

in demand and supply would cause the currency to depreciate. Here, we draw no effect on the quantity traded, but

in truth it could be an increase or a decrease, depending on the actual movements of demand and supply.

Purchasing Power Parity

Over the long term, exchange rates must bear some relationship to the currency's buying power in terms of

internationally traded goods. If at a certain exchange rate it was much cheaper to buy internationally traded

goods—such as oil, steel, computers, and cars—in one country than in another country, businesses would start

buying in the cheap country, selling in other countries, and pocketing the profits.

For example, if a U.S. dollar is worth $1.30 in Canadian currency, then a car that sells for $20,000 in the United

States should sell for $26,000 in Canada. If the price of cars in Canada were much lower than $26,000, then at

least some U.S. car-buyers would convert their U.S. dollars to Canadian dollars and buy their cars in Canada. If

the price of cars were much higher than $26,000 in this example, then at least some Canadian buyers would
convert their Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars and go to the United States to purchase their cars. This is known

as arbitrage, the process of buying and selling goods or currencies across international borders at a profit. It

may occur slowly, but over time, it will force prices and exchange rates to align so that the price of

internationally traded goods is similar in all countries.

We call the exchange rate that equalizes the prices of internationally traded goods across countries the

purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rate. A group of economists at the International Comparison

Program, run by the World Bank, have calculated the PPP exchange rate for all countries, based on detailed

studies of the prices and quantities of internationally tradable goods.

The purchasing power parity exchange rate has two functions. First, economists often use PPP exchange rates

for international comparison of GDP and other economic statistics. Imagine that you are preparing a table

showing the size of GDP in many countries in several recent years, and for ease of comparison, you are

converting all the values into U.S. dollars. When you insert the value for Japan, you need to use a yen/dollar

exchange rate. However, should you use the market exchange rate or the PPP exchange rate? Market exchange

rates bounce around. In 2014, the exchange rate was 105 yen/dollar, but in late 2015 the U.S. dollar exchange

rate versus the yen was 121 yen/dollar. For simplicity, say that Japan’s GDP was ¥500 trillion in both 2014 and

2015. If you use the market exchange rates, then Japan’s GDP will be $4.8 trillion in 2014 (that is, ¥500 trillion

/(¥105/dollar)) and $4.1 trillion in 2015 (that is, ¥500 trillion /(¥121/dollar)).

The misleading appearance of a changing Japanese economy occurs only because we used the market

exchange rate, which often has short-run rises and falls. However, PPP exchange rates stay fairly constant and

change only modestly, if at all, from year to year.

The second function of PPP is that exchanges rates will often get closer to it as time passes. It is true that in the

short and medium run, as exchange rates adjust to relative inflation rates, rates of return, and to expectations

about how interest rates and inflation will shift, the exchange rates will often move away from the PPP

exchange rate for a time. However, knowing the PPP will allow you to track and predict exchange rate

relationships.

16.3 Macroeconomic Effects of Exchange Rates

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section you will be able to:

• Explain how exchange rate shifting influences aggregate demand and supply

Access for free at openstax.org

16.3 • Macroeconomic Effects of Exchange Rates 399

A central bank will be concerned about the exchange rate for multiple reasons: (1) Movements in the exchange

rate will affect the quantity of aggregate demand in an economy; (2) frequent substantial fluctuations in the

exchange rate can disrupt international trade and cause problems in a nation’s banking system–this may

contribute to an unsustainable balance of trade and large inflows of international financial capital, which can

set up the economy for a deep recession if international investors decide to move their money to another

country. Let’s discuss these scenarios in turn.

Exchange Rates, Aggregate Demand, and Aggregate Supply

Foreign trade in goods and services typically involves incurring the costs of production in one currency while

receiving revenues from sales in another currency. As a result, movements in exchange rates can have a

powerful effect on incentives to export and import, and thus on aggregate demand in the economy as a whole.

For example, in 1999, when the euro first became a currency, its value measured in U.S. currency was $1.16/

euro, which dropped to a low of about $0.83/euro in 2000. By the end of 2013, the euro had risen (and the U.S.

dollar had correspondingly weakened) to $1.37/euro. However, by the beginning of 2021, the exchange rate

was down to $1.12/euro. Consider the situation of a French firm that each year incurs €10 million in costs, and

sells its products in the United States for $10 million. At a time in 1999, when this firm converted $10 million

back to euros at the exchange rate of $1.06/euro (that is, $10 million × [€1/$1.06]), it received €9.4 million, and

suffered a loss. In 2013, when this same firm converted $10 million back to euros at the exchange rate of

$1.37/euro (that is, $10 million × [€1 euro/$1.37]), it received approximately €7.3 million and an even larger

loss. In the beginning of 2021, with the exchange rate back at $1.12/euro the firm would suffer a loss once

again. This example shows how a stronger euro discourages exports by the French firm, because it makes the

costs of production in the domestic currency higher relative to the sales revenues earned in another country.

From the point of view of the U.S. economy, the example also shows how a weaker U.S. dollar encourages

exports.

Since an increase in exports results in more dollars flowing into the economy, and an increase in imports

means more dollars are flowing out, it is easy to conclude that exports are “good” for the economy and imports

are “bad,” but this overlooks the role of exchange rates. If an American consumer buys a Japanese car for

$20,000 instead of an American car for $30,000, it may be tempting to argue that the American economy has

lost out. However, the Japanese company will have to convert those dollars to yen to pay its workers and

operate its factories. Whoever buys those dollars will have to use them to purchase American goods and

services, so the money comes right back into the American economy. At the same time, the consumer saves

money by buying a less expensive import, and can use the extra money for other purposes.

Fluctuations in Exchange Rates

Exchange rates can fluctuate a great deal in the short run. As yet one more example, the Indian rupee moved

from 39 rupees/dollar in February 2008 to 51 rupees/dollar in March 2009, a decline of more than one-fourth

in the value of the rupee on foreign exchange markets. Figure 16.9 earlier showed that even two economically

developed neighboring economies like the United States and Canada can see significant movements in

exchange rates over a few years. For firms that depend on export sales, or firms that rely on imported inputs to

production, or even purely domestic firms that compete with firms tied into international trade—which in

many countries adds up to half or more of a nation’s GDP—sharp movements in exchange rates can lead to

dramatic changes in profits and losses. A central bank may desire to keep exchange rates from moving too

much as part of providing a stable business climate, where firms can focus on productivity and innovation, not

on reacting to exchange rate fluctuations.

One of the most economically destructive effects of exchange rate fluctuations can happen through the

banking system. Financial institutions measure most international loans are measured in a few large

currencies, like U.S. dollars, European euros, and Japanese yen. In countries that do not use these currencies,

banks often borrow funds in the currencies of other countries, like U.S. dollars, but then lend in their own

400 16 • Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows

domestic currency. The left-hand chain of events in Figure 16.9 shows how this pattern of international

borrowing can work. A bank in Thailand borrows one million in U.S. dollars. Then the bank converts the

dollars to its domestic currency—in the case of Thailand, the currency is the baht—at a rate of 40 baht/dollar.

The bank then lends the baht to a firm in Thailand. The business repays the loan in baht, and the bank

converts it back to U.S. dollars to pay off its original U.S. dollar loan.

FIGURE 16.9 International Borrowing The scenario of international borrowing that ends on the left is a success

story, but the scenario that ends on the right shows what happens when the exchange rate weakens.

This process of borrowing in a foreign currency and lending in a domestic currency can work just fine, as long

as the exchange rate does not shift. In the scenario outlined, if the dollar strengthens and the baht weakens, a

problem arises. The right-hand chain of events in Figure 16.9 illustrates what happens when the baht

unexpectedly weakens from 40 baht/dollar to 50 baht/dollar. The Thai firm still repays the loan in full to the

bank. However, because of the shift in the exchange rate, the bank cannot repay its loan in U.S. dollars. (Of

course, if the exchange rate had changed in the other direction, making the Thai currency stronger, the bank

could have realized an unexpectedly large profit.)

In 1997–1998, countries across eastern Asia, like Thailand, Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia, experienced a

sharp depreciation of their currencies, in some cases 50% or more. These countries had been experiencing

substantial inflows of foreign investment capital, with bank lending increasing by 20% to 30% per year

through the mid-1990s. When their exchange rates depreciated, the banking systems in these countries were

bankrupt. Argentina experienced a similar chain of events in 2002. When the Argentine peso depreciated,

Access for free at openstax.org

16.4 • Exchange Rate Policies 401

Argentina’s banks found themselves unable to pay back what they had borrowed in U.S. dollars.

Banks play a vital role in any economy in facilitating transactions and in making loans to firms and consumers.

When most of a country’s largest banks become bankrupt simultaneously, a sharp decline in aggregate

demand and a deep recession results. Since the main responsibilities of a central bank are to control the

money supply and to ensure that the banking system is stable, a central bank must be concerned about

whether large and unexpected exchange rate depreciation will drive most of the country’s existing banks into

bankruptcy. For more on this concern, return to the chapter on The International Trade and Capital Flows.

Summing Up Public Policy and Exchange Rates

Every nation would prefer a stable exchange rate to facilitate international trade and reduce the degree of risk

and uncertainty in the economy. However, a nation may sometimes want a weaker exchange rate to stimulate

aggregate demand and reduce a recession, or a stronger exchange rate to fight inflation. The country must also

be concerned that rapid movements from a weak to a strong exchange rate may hurt its export industries,

while rapid movements from a strong to a weak exchange rate can hurt its banking sector. In short, every

choice of an exchange rate—whether it should be stronger or weaker, or fixed or changing—represents

potential tradeoffs.

16.4 Exchange Rate Policies

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Differentiate among a floating exchange rate, a soft peg, a hard peg, and a merged currency

•

Identify the tradeoffs that come with a floating exchange rate, a soft peg, a hard peg, and a merged

currency

Exchange rate policies come in a range of different forms listed in Figure 16.10: let the foreign exchange

market determine the exchange rate; let the market set the value of the exchange rate most of the time, but

have the central bank sometimes intervene to prevent fluctuations that seem too large; have the central bank

guarantee a specific exchange rate; or share a currency with other countries. Let’s discuss each type of

exchange rate policy and its tradeoffs.

FIGURE 16.10 A Spectrum of Exchange Rate Policies A nation may adopt one of a variety of exchange rate regimes,

from floating rates in which the foreign exchange market determines the rates to pegged rates where governments

intervene to manage the exchange rate's value, to a common currency where the nation adopts another country or

group of countries' currency.

Floating Exchange Rates

We refer to a policy which allows the foreign exchange market to set exchange rates as a floating exchange

rate. The U.S. dollar is a floating exchange rate, as are the currencies of about 40% of the countries in the world

economy. The major concern with this policy is that exchange rates can move a great deal in a short time.

Consider the U.S. exchange rate expressed in terms of another fairly stable currency, the Japanese yen, as

Figure 16.11 shows. On January 1, 2002, the exchange rate was 133 yen/dollar. On January 1, 2005, it was 103

yen/dollar. On June 1, 2007, it was 122 yen/dollar, on January 1, 2012, it was 77 yen per dollar, and on March 1,

2015, it was 120 yen per dollar. Since 2015, it has dropped again; by the end of December 2020, the exchange

402 16 • Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows

rate stood at 103 yen per dollar. As investor sentiment swings back and forth, driving exchange rates up and

down, exporters, importers, and banks involved in international lending are all affected. At worst, large

movements in exchange rates can drive companies into bankruptcy or trigger a nationwide banking collapse.

However, even in the moderate case of the yen/dollar exchange rate, these movements of roughly 30 percent

back and forth impose stress on both economies as firms must alter their export and import plans to take the

new exchange rates into account. Especially in smaller countries where international trade is a relatively large

share of GDP, exchange rate movements can rattle their economies.

FIGURE 16.11 U.S. Dollar Exchange Rate in Japanese Yen Even seemingly stable exchange rates such as the

Japanese Yen to the U.S. Dollar can vary when closely examined over time. This figure shows a relatively stable rate

between 2011 and 2013. In 2013, there was a drastic depreciation of the Yen (relative to the U.S. Dollar) by about

14% and again at the end of the year in 2014 also by about 14%. Since then, between 2016 and 2020 there was an

appreciation of about 13% from 118 yen per dollar to 103 yen per dollar. (Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data

(FRED) https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DEXJPUS)

However, movements of floating exchange rates have advantages, too. After all, prices of goods and services

rise and fall throughout a market economy, as demand and supply shift. If an economy experiences strong

inflows or outflows of international financial capital, or has relatively high inflation, or if it experiences strong

productivity growth so that purchasing power changes relative to other economies, then it makes economic

sense for the exchange rate to shift as well.

Floating exchange rate advocates often argue that if government policies were more predictable and stable,

then inflation rates and interest rates would be more predictable and stable. Exchange rates would bounce
around less, too. The economist Milton Friedman (1912–2006), for example, wrote a defense of floating

exchange rates in 1962 in his book Capitalism and Freedom:

Being in favor of floating exchange rates does not mean being in favor of unstable exchange rates.

When we support a free price system [for goods and services] at home, this does not imply that we

favor a system in which prices fluctuate wildly up and down. What we want is a system in which prices

are free to fluctuate but in which the forces determining them are sufficiently stable so that in fact

prices move within moderate ranges. This is equally true in a system of floating exchange rates. The

ultimate objective is a world in which exchange rates, while free to vary, are, in fact, highly stable

because basic economic policies and conditions are stable.

Advocates of floating exchange rates admit that, yes, exchange rates may sometimes fluctuate. They point out,

however, that if a central bank focuses on preventing either high inflation or deep recession, with low and

reasonably steady interest rates, then exchange rates will have less reason to vary.

16.4 • Exchange Rate Policies 403

Using Soft Pegs and Hard Pegs

When a government intervenes in the foreign exchange market so that the currency's exchange rate is

different from what the market would have produced, it establishes a “peg” for its currency. A soft peg is the

name for an exchange rate policy where the government usually allows the market to set exchange rate, but in

some cases, especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving rapidly in one direction, the central bank will

intervene in the market. With a hard peg exchange rate policy, the central bank sets a fixed and unchanging

value for the exchange rate. A central bank can implement soft peg and hard peg policies.

Suppose the market exchange rate for the Brazilian currency, the real, would be 35 cents/real with a daily
quantity of 15 billion real traded in the market, as the equilibrium E0 in Figure 16.12 (a) and Figure 16.12 (b)
show. However, Brazil's government decides that the exchange rate should be 30 cents/real, as Figure 16.12 (a)

shows. Perhaps Brazil sets this lower exchange rate to benefit its export industries. Perhaps it is an attempt to

stimulate aggregate demand by stimulating exports. Perhaps Brazil believes that the current market exchange

rate is higher than the long-term purchasing power parity value of the real, so it is minimizing fluctuations in

the real by keeping it at this lower rate. Perhaps the government set the target exchange rate sometime in the

past, and it is now maintaining it for the sake of stability. Whatever the reason, if Brazil’s central bank wishes to
keep the exchange rate below the market level, it must face the reality that at this weaker exchange rate of 30
cents/real, the quantity demanded of its currency at 17 billion reals is greater than the quantity supplied of 13

billion reals in the foreign exchange market.

FIGURE 16.12 Pegging an Exchange Rate (a) If an exchange rate is pegged below what would otherwise be the

equilibrium, then the currency's quantity demanded will exceed the quantity supplied. (b) If an exchange rate is

pegged above what would otherwise be the equilibrium, then the currency's quantity supplied exceeds the quantity

demanded.

The Brazilian central bank could weaken its exchange rate in two ways. One approach is to use an

expansionary monetary policy that leads to lower interest rates. In foreign exchange markets, the lower

interest rates will reduce demand and increase supply of the real and lead to depreciation. Central banks do

not use this technique often because lowering interest rates to weaken the currency may be in conflict with the

country’s monetary policy goals. Alternatively, Brazil’s central bank could trade directly in the foreign

exchange market. The central bank can expand the money supply by creating reals, use the reals to purchase

foreign currencies, and avoid selling any of its own currency. In this way, it can fill the gap between quantity

demanded and quantity supplied of its currency.

Figure 16.12 (b) shows the opposite situation. Here, the Brazilian government desires a stronger exchange rate

of 40 cents/real than the market rate of 35 cents/real. Perhaps Brazil desires the stronger currency to reduce

aggregate demand and to fight inflation, or perhaps Brazil believes that that current market exchange rate is

404 16 • Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows

temporarily lower than the long-term rate. Whatever the reason, at the higher desired exchange rate, the

quantity supplied of 16 billion reals exceeds the quantity demanded of 14 billion reals.

Brazil’s central bank can use a contractionary monetary policy to raise interest rates, which will increase

demand and reduce currency supply on foreign exchange markets, and lead to an appreciation. Alternatively,

Brazil’s central bank can trade directly in the foreign exchange market. In this case, with an excess supply of its

own currency in foreign exchange markets, the central bank must use reserves of foreign currency, like U.S.

dollars, to demand its own currency and thus cause an appreciation of its exchange rate.

Both a soft peg and a hard peg policy require that the central bank intervene in the foreign exchange market.

However, a hard peg policy attempts to preserve a fixed exchange rate at all times. A soft peg policy typically

allows the exchange rate to move up and down by relatively small amounts in the short run of several months

or a year, and to move by larger amounts over time, but seeks to avoid extreme short-term fluctuations.

Tradeoffs of Soft Pegs and Hard Pegs

When a country decides to alter the market exchange rate, it faces a number of tradeoffs. If it uses monetary

policy to alter the exchange rate, it then cannot at the same time use monetary policy to address issues of

inflation or recession. If it uses direct purchases and sales of foreign currencies in exchange rates, then it must
face the issue of how it will handle its reserves of foreign currency. Finally, a pegged exchange rate can even

create additional movements of the exchange rate. For example, even the possibility of government

intervention in exchange rate markets will lead to rumors about whether and when the government will

intervene, and dealers in the foreign exchange market will react to those rumors. Let’s consider these issues in

turn.

One concern with pegged exchange rate policies is that they imply a country’s monetary policy is no longer

focused on controlling inflation or shortening recessions, but now must also take the exchange rate into

account. For example, when a country pegs its exchange rate, it will sometimes face economic situations where

it would like to have an expansionary monetary policy to fight recession—but it cannot do so because that

policy would depreciate its exchange rate and break its hard peg. With a soft peg exchange rate policy, the

central bank can sometimes ignore the exchange rate and focus on domestic inflation or recession—but in

other cases the central bank may ignore inflation or recession and instead focus on its soft peg exchange rate.

With a hard peg policy, domestic monetary policy is effectively no longer determined by domestic inflation or

unemployment, but only by what monetary policy is needed to keep the exchange rate at the hard peg.

Another issue arises when a central bank intervenes directly in the exchange rate market. If a central bank

ends up in a situation where it is perpetually creating and selling its own currency on foreign exchange

markets, it will be buying the currency of other countries, like U.S. dollars or euros, to hold as reserves. Holding

large reserves of other currencies has an opportunity cost, and central banks will not wish to boost such

reserves without limit.

In addition, a central bank that causes a large increase in the supply of money is also risking an inflationary

surge in aggregate demand. Conversely, when a central bank wishes to buy its own currency, it can do so by

using its reserves of international currency like the U.S. dollar or the euro. However, if the central bank runs

out of such reserves, it can no longer use this method to strengthen its currency. Thus, buying foreign

currencies in exchange rate markets can be expensive and inflationary, while selling foreign currencies can

work only until a central bank runs out of reserves.

Yet another issue is that when a government pegs its exchange rate, it may unintentionally create another

reason for additional fluctuation. With a soft peg policy, foreign exchange dealers and international investors

react to every rumor about how or when the central bank is likely to intervene to influence the exchange rate,

and as they react to rumors the exchange rate will shift up and down. Thus, even though the goal of a soft peg

policy is to reduce short-term fluctuations of the exchange rate, the existence of the policy—when anticipated

in the foreign exchange market—may sometimes increase short-term fluctuations as international investors

try to anticipate how and when the central bank will act. The following Clear It Up feature discusses the effects

of international capital flows—capital that flows across national boundaries as either portfolio investment or

16.4 • Exchange Rate Policies 405

direct investment.

CLEAR IT UP

How do Tobin taxes control the flow of capital?
Some countries like Chile and Malaysia have sought to reduce movements in exchange rates by limiting international

financial capital inflows and outflows. The government can enact this policy either through targeted taxes or by

regulations.

Taxes on international capital flows are sometimes known as Tobin taxes, named after James Tobin, the 1981

Nobel laureate in economics who proposed such a tax in a 1972 lecture. For example, a government might tax all

foreign exchange transactions, or attempt to tax short-term portfolio investment while exempting long-term foreign

direct investment. Countries can also use regulation to forbid certain kinds of foreign investment in the first place or

to make it difficult for international financial investors to withdraw their funds from a country.

The goal of such policies is to reduce international capital flows, especially short-term portfolio flows, in the hope
that doing so will reduce the chance of large movements in exchange rates that can bring macroeconomic disaster.

However, proposals to limit international financial flows have severe practical difficulties. National governments

impose taxes, not international ones. If one government imposes a Tobin tax on exchange rate transactions carried

out within its territory, a firm based someplace like the Grand Caymans, an island nation in the Caribbean well-

known for allowing some financial wheeling and dealing might easily operate the exchange rate market. In an

interconnected global economy, if goods and services are allowed to flow across national borders, then payments

need to flow across borders, too. It is very difficult—in fact close to impossible—for a nation to allow only the flows

of payments that relate to goods and services, while clamping down or taxing other flows of financial capital. If a

nation participates in international trade, it must also participate in international capital movements.

Finally, countries all over the world, especially low-income countries, are crying out for foreign investment to help

develop their economies. Policies that discourage international financial investment may prevent some possible

harm, but they rule out potentially substantial economic benefits as well.

A hard peg exchange rate policy will not allow short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate. If the government

first announces a hard peg and then later changes its mind—perhaps the government becomes unwilling to

keep interest rates high or to hold high levels of foreign exchange reserves—then the result of abandoning a

hard peg could be a dramatic shift in the exchange rate.

In the mid-2000s, about one-third of the countries in the world used a soft peg approach and about one-

quarter used a hard peg approach. The general trend in the 1990s was to shift away from a soft peg approach

in favor of either floating rates or a hard peg. The concern is that a successful soft peg policy may, for a time,

lead to very little variation in exchange rates, so that firms and banks in the economy begin to act as if a hard

peg exists. When the exchange rate does move, the effects are especially painful because firms and banks have

not planned and hedged against a possible change. Thus, the argument went, it is better either to be clear that

the exchange rate is always flexible, or that it is fixed, but choosing an in-between soft peg option may end up

being worst of all.

A Merged Currency

A final approach to exchange rate policy is for a nation to choose a common currency shared with one or more

nations is also called a merged currency. A merged currency approach eliminates foreign exchange risk

altogether. Just as no one worries about exchange rate movements when buying and selling between New York

and California, Europeans know that the value of the euro will be the same in Germany and France and other

406 16 • Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows

European nations that have adopted the euro.

However, a merged currency also poses problems. Like a hard peg, a merged currency means that a nation has

given up altogether on domestic monetary policy, and instead has put its interest rate policies in other hands.

When Ecuador uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, it has no voice in whether the Federal Reserve raises or

lowers interest rates. The European Central Bank that determines monetary policy for the euro has

representatives from all the euro nations. However, from the standpoint of, say, Portugal, there will be times

when the decisions of the European Central Bank about monetary policy do not match the decisions that a

Portuguese central bank would have made.

The lines between these four different exchange rate policies can blend into each other. For example, a soft peg

exchange rate policy in which the government almost never acts to intervene in the exchange rate market will

look a great deal like a floating exchange rate. Conversely, a soft peg policy in which the government intervenes

often to keep the exchange rate near a specific level will look a lot like a hard peg. A decision to merge

currencies with another country is, in effect, a decision to have a permanently fixed exchange rate with those

countries, which is like a very hard exchange rate peg. Table 16.3 summarizes the range of exchange rates

policy choices, with their advantages and disadvantages.

16.4 • Exchange Rate Policies 407

Global macroeconomics would be easier if the whole world had one currency and one central bank. The

exchange rates between different currencies complicate the picture. If financial markets solely set exchange

rates, they fluctuate substantially as short-term portfolio investors try to anticipate tomorrow’s news. If the

government attempts to intervene in exchange rate markets through soft pegs or hard pegs, it gives up at least

some of the power to use monetary policy to focus on domestic inflations and recessions, and it risks causing

even greater fluctuations in foreign exchange markets.

There is no consensus among economists about which exchange rate policies are best: floating, soft peg, hard

peg, or merged currencies. The choice depends both on how well a nation’s central bank can implement a

specific exchange rate policy and on how well a nation’s firms and banks can adapt to different exchange rate

policies. A national economy that does a fairly good job at achieving the four main economic goals of growth,

low inflation, low unemployment, and a sustainable balance of trade will probably do just fine most of the time

with any exchange rate policy. Conversely, no exchange rate policy is likely to save an economy that

consistently fails at achieving these goals. Alternatively, a merged currency applied across wide geographic

and cultural areas carries with it its own set of problems, such as the ability for countries to conduct their own

independent monetary policies.

Is a Stronger Dollar Good for the U.S. Economy?
The foreign exchange value of the dollar is a price and whether a higher price is good or bad depends on where you

are standing: sellers benefit from higher prices and buyers are harmed. A stronger dollar is good for U.S. imports

(and people working for U.S. importers) and U.S. investment abroad. It is also good for U.S. tourists going to other

countries, since their dollar goes further. However, a stronger dollar is bad for U.S. exports (and people working in

U.S. export industries); it is bad for foreign investment in the United States (leading, for example, to higher U.S.

interest rates); and it is bad for foreign tourists (as well as U.S hotels, restaurants, and others in the tourist industry).

In short, whether the U.S. dollar is good or bad is a more complex question than you may have thought. The

economic answer is “it depends.”

Key Concepts and Summary

16.1 How the Foreign Exchange Market Works

In the foreign exchange market, people and firms exchange one currency to purchase another currency. The

demand for dollars comes from those U.S. export firms seeking to convert their earnings in foreign currency

back into U.S. dollars; foreign tourists converting their earnings in a foreign currency back into U.S. dollars;

and foreign investors seeking to make financial investments in the U.S. economy. On the supply side of the

foreign exchange market for the trading of U.S. dollars are foreign firms that have sold imports in the U.S.

economy and are seeking to convert their earnings back to their home currency; U.S. tourists abroad; and U.S.

investors seeking to make financial investments in foreign economies. When currency A can buy more of

currency B, then currency A has strengthened or appreciated relative to B. When currency A can buy less of

currency B, then currency A has weakened or depreciated relative to B. If currency A strengthens or

appreciates relative to currency B, then currency B must necessarily weaken or depreciate with regard to

currency A. A stronger currency benefits those who are buying with that currency and injures those who are

selling. A weaker currency injures those, like importers, who are buying with that currency and benefits those

who are selling with it, like exporters.

16.2 Demand and Supply Shifts in Foreign Exchange Markets

In the extreme short run, ranging from a few minutes to a few weeks, speculators who are trying to invest in

currencies that will grow stronger, and to sell currencies that will grow weaker influence exchange rates. Such

speculation can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, at least for a time, where an expected appreciation leads to a

stronger currency and vice versa. In the relatively short run, differences in rates of return influence exchange

rate markets. Countries with relatively high real rates of return (for example, high interest rates) will tend to

experience stronger currencies as they attract money from abroad, while countries with relatively low rates of

return will tend to experience weaker exchange rates as investors convert to other currencies.

Access for free at openstax.org

16 • Self-Check Questions 409

In the medium run of a few months or a few years, inflation rates influence exchange rate markets. Countries

with relatively high inflation will tend to experience less demand for their currency than countries with lower

inflation, and thus currency depreciation. Over long periods of many years, exchange rates tend to adjust

toward the purchasing power parity (PPP) rate, which is the exchange rate such that the prices of

internationally tradable goods in different countries, when converted at the PPP exchange rate to a common

currency, are similar in all economies.

16.3 Macroeconomic Effects of Exchange Rates

A central bank will be concerned about the exchange rate for several reasons. Exchange rates will affect

imports and exports, and thus affect aggregate demand in the economy. Fluctuations in exchange rates may

cause difficulties for many firms, but especially banks. The exchange rate may accompany unsustainable flows

of international financial capital.

16.4 Exchange Rate Policies

In a floating exchange rate policy, a government determines its country’s exchange rate in the foreign

exchange market. In a soft peg exchange rate policy, the foreign exchange market usually determines a

country's exchange rate, but the government sometimes intervenes to strengthen or weaken it. In a hard peg
exchange rate policy, the government chooses an exchange rate. A central bank can intervene in exchange

markets in two ways. It can raise or lower interest rates to make the currency stronger or weaker. It also can

directly purchase or sell its currency in foreign exchange markets. All exchange rates policies face tradeoffs. A

hard peg exchange rate policy will reduce exchange rate fluctuations, but means that a country must focus its

monetary policy on the exchange rate, not on fighting recession or controlling inflation. When a nation merges

its currency with another nation, it gives up on nationally oriented monetary policy altogether.

A soft peg exchange rate may create additional volatility as exchange rate markets try to anticipate when and

how the government will intervene. A flexible exchange rate policy allows monetary policy to focus on inflation

and unemployment, and allows the exchange rate to change with inflation and rates of return, but also raises a

risk that exchange rates may sometimes make large and abrupt movements. The spectrum of exchange rate

policies includes: (a) a floating exchange rate, (b) a pegged exchange rate, soft or hard, and (c) a merged

currency. Monetary policy can focus on a variety of goals: (a) inflation; (b) inflation or unemployment,

depending on which is the most dangerous obstacle; and (c) a long-term rule based policy designed to keep the

money supply stable and predictable.

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES

In this chapter, you will learn about:

• Federal Deficits and the National Debt

• Using Fiscal Policy to Fight Recessions, Unemployment, and Inflation

• Automatic Stabilizers

• Practical Problems with Discretionary Fiscal Policy

• The Question of a Balanced Budget

Introduction to Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy

BRING IT HOME

No Yellowstone Park?
You had trekked all the way to see Yellowstone National Park in the beautiful month of October 2013, only to find

it… closed. Closed! Why?

For two weeks in October 2013, the U.S. federal government shut down. Many federal services, like the national

parks, closed and 800,000 federal employees were furloughed. Tourists were shocked and so was the rest of the

world: Congress and the President could not agree on a budget. Inside the Capitol, Republicans and Democrats

414 17 • Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy

argued about spending priorities and whether to increase the national debt limit. Each year's budget, which is over

$3 trillion of spending, must be approved by Congress and signed by the President. Two thirds of the budget are

entitlements and other mandatory spending which occur without congressional or presidential action once the

programs are established. Tied to the budget debate was the issue of increasing the debt ceiling—how high the U.S.

government's national debt can be. The House of Representatives refused to sign on to the bills to fund the

government unless they included provisions to stop or change the Affordable Health Care Act (more colloquially

known as Obamacare). As the days progressed, the United States came very close to defaulting on its debt.

October 2013 was not the first time the government shut down, and it was not the last. Several brief shutdowns

occurred in the early 1980s, and they occurred periodically in the following years. The longest shutdown took place

between December 2018 and January 2019, when funding a border wall was a core disagreement.

Why does the federal budget create such intense debates? What would happen if the United States actually

defaulted on its debt? In this chapter, we will examine the federal budget, taxation, and fiscal policy. We will also

look at the annual federal budget deficits and the national debt.

All levels of government—federal, state, and local—have budgets that show how much revenue the government

expects to receive in taxes and other income and how the government plans to spend it. Budgets, however, can

shift dramatically within a few years, as policy decisions and unexpected events disrupt earlier tax and

spending plans.

In this chapter, we revisit fiscal policy, which we first covered in Welcome to Economics! Fiscal policy is one of

two policy tools for fine tuning the economy (the other is monetary policy). While policymakers at the Federal

Reserve make monetary policy, Congress and the President make fiscal policy.

The discussion of fiscal policy focuses on how federal government taxing and spending affects aggregate

demand. All government spending and taxes affect the economy, but fiscal policy focuses strictly on federal

government policies. We begin with an overview of U.S. government spending and taxes. We then discuss fiscal

policy from a short-run perspective; that is, how government uses tax and spending policies to address

recession, unemployment, and inflation; how periods of recession and growth affect government budgets; and

the merits of balanced budget proposals.

17.1 Government Spending

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•

Identify U.S. budget deficit and surplus trends over the past five decades

• Explain the differences between the U.S. federal budget, and state and local budgets

Government spending covers a range of services that the federal, state, and local governments provide. When

the federal government spends more money than it receives in taxes in a given year, it runs a budget deficit.

Conversely, when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in a year, it runs a budget

surplus. If government spending and taxes are equal, it has a balanced budget. For example, in 2020, the U.S.

government experienced its largest budget deficit ever, as the federal government spent $3.1 trillion more than

it collected in taxes. This deficit was about 15% of the size of the U.S. GDP in 2020, making it by far the largest

budget deficit relative to GDP since the mammoth borrowing the government used to finance World War II. To

put it into perspective, the previous record deficits were experienced during the Great Recession of

2007–2009, when the deficit reached 9.6% of GDP.

This section presents an overview of government spending in the United States.

Total U.S. Government Spending

Federal spending in nominal dollars (that is, dollars not adjusted for inflation) has grown by a multiple of more

Access for free at openstax.org

17.1 • Government Spending 415

than 38 over the last four decades, from $93.4 billion in 1960 to $6.8 trillion in 2020. Comparing spending over

time in nominal dollars is misleading because it does not take into account inflation or growth in population

and the real economy. A more useful method of comparison is to examine government spending as a percent

of GDP over time.

The top line in Figure 17.2 shows the federal spending level since 1960, expressed as a share of GDP. Despite a

widespread sense among many Americans that the federal government has been growing steadily larger, the

graph shows that federal spending has hovered in a range from 18% to 22% of GDP most of the time since

1960. For example, throughout the latter part of the 2010s, government expenditures were around 20% of GDP.

The other lines in Figure 17.2 show the major federal spending categories: national defense, Social Security,

health programs, and interest payments. From the graph, we see that national defense spending as a share of

GDP has generally declined since the 1960s, although there were some upward bumps in the 1980s buildup

under President Ronald Reagan and in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. In

contrast, Social Security and healthcare have grown steadily as a percent of GDP. Healthcare expenditures

include both payments for senior citizens (Medicare), and payments for low-income Americans (Medicaid).

State governments also partially fund Medicaid. Interest payments are the final main category of government

spending in Figure 30.2.

FIGURE 17.2 Federal Spending, 1960–2020 Since 1960, total federal spending has ranged from about 18% to 22%

of GDP. It climbed above that level in 2009, quickly dropped back down to that level by 2013, and again climbed

above that level in 2020. The share that the government has spent on national defense has generally declined, while

the share it has spent on Social Security and on healthcare expenses (mainly Medicare and Medicaid) has increased.

(Source: Economic Report of the President, 2021, Table B47, https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/erp/2021)

Each year, the government borrows funds from U.S. citizens and foreigners to cover its budget deficits. It does

this by selling securities (Treasury bonds, notes, and bills)—in essence borrowing from the public and

promising to repay with interest in the future. From 1961 to 1997, the U.S. government has run budget deficits,

and thus borrowed funds, in almost every year. It had budget surpluses from 1998 to 2001, and then returned

to deficits.

The interest payments on past federal government borrowing were typically 1–2% of GDP in the 1960s and

1970s but then climbed above 3% of GDP in the 1980s and stayed there until the late 1990s. The government

was able to repay some of its past borrowing by running surpluses from 1998 to 2001 and, with help from low

interest rates, the interest payments on past federal government borrowing had fallen back to 1.6% of GDP by

2020.

We investigate the government borrowing and debt patterns in more detail later in this chapter, but first we

416 17 • Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy

need to clarify the difference between the deficit and the debt. The deficit is not the debt. The difference

between the deficit and the debt lies in the time frame. The government deficit (or surplus) refers to what

happens with the federal government budget each year. The government debt is accumulated over time. It is

the sum of all past deficits and surpluses. If you borrow $10,000 per year for each of the four years of college,

you might say that your annual deficit was $10,000, but your accumulated debt over the four years is $40,000.

These four categories—national defense, Social Security, healthcare, and interest payments—generally account

for roughly 60% of all federal spending, as Figure 17.3 shows. (Due to the large amount of one-time

expenditures by the federal government in 2020 due to the pandemic, the 2019 statistics are presented here.)

The remaining 40% wedge of the pie chart covers all other categories of federal government spending:

international affairs; science and technology; natural resources and the environment; transportation; housing;

education; income support for people in poverty; community and regional development; law enforcement and

the judicial system; and the administrative costs of running the government.

FIGURE 17.3 Slices of Federal Spending, 2019 About 60% of government spending goes to four major areas:

national defense, Social Security, healthcare, and interest payments on past borrowing. This leaves about 40% of

federal spending for all other functions of the U.S. government. (Source: https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/

Historicals/)

State and Local Government Spending

Although federal government spending often gets most of the media attention, state and local government

spending is also substantial—at about $3.3 trillion in 2021. Figure 17.4 shows that state and local government

spending has increased during the last four decades from around 8% to around 14% today. The single biggest

item is education, which accounts for about one-third of the total. The rest covers programs like highways,
libraries, hospitals and healthcare, parks, and police and fire protection. Unlike the federal government, all

states (except Vermont) have balanced budget laws, which means any gaps between revenues and spending

must be closed by higher taxes, lower spending, drawing down their previous savings, or some combination of

all of these.

FIGURE 17.4 State and Local Spending, 1960–2020 Spending by state and local government increased from about

10% of GDP in the early 1960s to 14–16% by the mid-1970s. It has remained at roughly that level since. The single

biggest spending item is education, including both K–12 spending and support for public colleges and universities,

which has been about 4–5% of GDP in recent decades. Source: (Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis,

U.S. presidential candidates often run for office pledging to improve the public schools or to get tough on

crime. However, in the U.S. government system, these tasks are primarily state and local government

responsibilities. In fiscal year 2020 state and local governments spent about $970 billion per year on education

(including K–12 and college and university education), compared to only $100 billion by the federal

government. In other words, about 90 cents of every dollar spent on education happens at the state and local

level. A politician who really wants hands-on responsibility for reforming education or reducing crime might

do better to run for mayor of a large city or for state governor rather than for president of the United States.

Taxes are paid by most, but not all, people who work. Even if you are part of the so-called “1099” or “gig”

economy, you are considered an independent contractor and must pay taxes on the income you earn in those

occupations. Taxes are also paid by consumers whenever they purchase goods and services. Taxes are used for

all sorts of spending—from roads, to bridges, to schools (K–12 and public higher education), to police and other

public safety functions. Taxes fund vital public services that support our communities.

17.2 Taxation

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Differentiate among a regressive tax, a proportional tax, and a progressive tax

•

Identify major revenue sources for the U.S. federal budget

There are two main categories of taxes: those that the federal government collects and those that the state and

local governments collect. What percentage the government collects and for what it uses that revenue varies

greatly. The following sections will briefly explain the taxation system in the United States.

Taxes are paid by most, but not all, people who work. Even if you are part of the so-called “1099” or “gig”

Federal Taxes

Just as many Americans erroneously think that federal spending has grown considerably, many also believe

that taxes have increased substantially. The top line of Figure 17.5 shows total federal taxes as a share of GDP

since 1960. Although the line rises and falls, it typically remains within the range of 17% to 20% of GDP, except

for 2009–2011, when taxes fell substantially below this level, due to the Great Recession.

FIGURE 17.5 Federal Taxes, 1960–2020 Federal tax revenues have been about 17–20% of GDP during most

periods in recent decades. The primary sources of federal taxes are individual income taxes and the payroll taxes

that finance Social Security and Medicare. Corporate income taxes and social insurance taxes provide smaller

shares of revenue. (Source: Economic Report of the President, 2021. Table B-47, https://www.govinfo.gov/app/

collection/erp/2021)

Figure 17.5 also shows the taxation patterns for the main categories that the federal government taxes:

individual income taxes, corporate income taxes, and social insurance and retirement receipts. When most

people think of federal government taxes, the first tax that comes to mind is the individual income tax that is

due every year on April 15 (or the first business day after). The personal income tax is the largest single source

of federal government revenue, but it still represents less than half of federal tax revenue.

The second largest source of federal revenue is the payroll tax (captured in social insurance and retirement

receipts), which provides funds for Social Security and Medicare. Payroll taxes have increased steadily over

time. Together, the personal income tax and the payroll tax accounted for over 85% of federal tax revenues in

2020. Although personal income tax revenues account for more total revenue than the payroll tax, nearly

three-quarters of households pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes.

The income tax is a progressive tax, which means that the tax rates increase as a household’s income

increases. Taxes also vary with marital status, family size, and other factors. The marginal tax rates (the tax

due on all yearly income) for a single taxpayer range from 10% to 35%, depending on income, as the following

Clear It Up feature explains.

CLEAR IT UP

How does the marginal rate work?
Suppose that a single taxpayer’s income is $35,000 per year. Also suppose that income from $0 to $9,075 is taxed

at 10%, income from $9,075 to $36,900 is taxed at 15%, and, finally, income from $36,900 and beyond is taxed at

25%. Since this person earns $35,000, their marginal tax rate is 15%.

17.2 • Taxation 419

The key fact here is that the federal income tax is designed so that tax rates increase as income increases, up to

a certain level. The payroll taxes that support Social Security and Medicare are designed in a different way.

First, the payroll taxes for Social Security are imposed at a rate of 12.4% up to a certain wage limit, set at

$137,700 in 2020. Medicare, on the other hand, pays for elderly healthcare, and is fixed at 2.9%, with no upper

ceiling.

In both cases, the employer and the employee split the payroll taxes. An employee only sees 6.2% deducted

from their paycheck for Social Security, and 1.45% from Medicare. However, as economists are quick to point

out, the employer’s half of the taxes are probably passed along to the employees in the form of lower wages, so

in reality, the worker pays all of the payroll taxes. If you are a member of the “gig economy” and receive a 1099

tax statement, then you are considered an independent contractor and so you must pay the employee and

employer side of the payroll tax.

We also call the Medicare payroll tax a proportional tax; that is, a flat percentage of all wages earned. The

Social Security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit, but above that level it becomes a regressive

tax, meaning that people with higher incomes pay a smaller share of their income in tax.

The third-largest source of federal tax revenue, as Figure 17.5 shows is the corporate income tax. The

common name for corporate income is “profits.” Over time, corporate income tax receipts have declined as a

share of GDP, from about 4% in the 1960s to an average of 1% to 2% of GDP in the past 40 years.

The federal government has a few other, smaller sources of revenue. It imposes an excise tax—that is, a tax on

a particular good—on gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol. As a share of GDP, the amount the government collects

from these taxes has stayed nearly constant over time, from about 2% of GDP in the 1960s to roughly 3% by

2020, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The government also imposes an estate and

gift tax on people who pass large amounts of assets to the next generation—either after death or during life in

the form of gifts. These estate and gift taxes collected about 0.2% of GDP in 2020. By a quirk of legislation, the

government repealed the estate and gift tax in 2010, but reinstated it in 2011. Other federal taxes, which are

also relatively small in magnitude, include tariffs the government collects on imported goods and charges for

inspections of goods entering the country.

State and Local Taxes

At the state and local level, taxes have been rising as a share of GDP over the last few decades to match the

gradual rise in spending, as Figure 17.6 illustrates. The main revenue sources for state and local governments

are sales taxes, property taxes, and revenue passed along from the federal government, but many state and

local governments also levy personal and corporate income taxes, as well as impose a wide variety of fees and

charges. The specific sources of tax revenue vary widely across state and local governments. Some states rely

more on property taxes, some on sales taxes, some on income taxes, and some more on revenues from the

federal government.

17.3 Federal Deficits and the National Debt

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain the U.S. federal budget in terms of annual debt and accumulated debt

• Understand how economic growth or decline can influence a budget surplus or budget deficit

Having discussed the revenue (taxes) and expense (spending) side of the budget, we now turn to the annual

budget deficit or surplus, which is the difference between the tax revenue collected and spending over a fiscal

year, which starts October 1 and ends September 30 of the next year.

Figure 17.7 shows the pattern of annual federal budget deficits and surpluses, back to 1930, as a share of GDP.

When the line is above the horizontal axis, the budget is in surplus. When the line is below the horizontal axis,

a budget deficit occurred. Clearly, the biggest deficits as a share of GDP during this time were incurred to

finance World War II. Deficits were also large during the 1930s, the 1980s, the early 1990s, 2007–2009 (the

Great Recession), and 2020 (the pandemic-induced recession).

FIGURE 17.7 Pattern of Federal Budget Deficits and Surpluses, 1929–2020 The federal government has run budget

deficits for decades. The budget was briefly in surplus in the late 1990s, before heading into deficit again in the first

decade of the 2000s—and especially deep deficits in the 2007-2009 and 2020 recessions. (Source: Federal Reserve

Federal Surplus or Deficit as a Percentage of Gross Domestic Product

Debt/GDP Ratio

Another useful way to view the budget deficit is through the prism of accumulated debt rather than annual

deficits. The national debt refers to the total amount that the government has borrowed over time. In contrast,

the budget deficit refers to how much the government has borrowed in one particular year. Figure 17.8 shows

the ratio of debt/GDP since 1966. Until the 1970s, the debt/GDP ratio revealed a fairly clear pattern of federal

borrowing. The government ran up large deficits and raised the debt/GDP ratio in World War II, but from the

1950s to the 1970s the government ran either surpluses or relatively small deficits, and so the debt/GDP ratio

drifted down. Large deficits in the 1980s and early 1990s caused the ratio to rise sharply. When budget

surpluses arrived from 1998 to 2001, the debt/GDP ratio declined substantially. The budget deficits starting in

2002 then tugged the debt/GDP ratio higher—with a big jump when the recession took hold in 2008–2009.

There was another leap in the ratio in 2020.

FIGURE 17.8 Federal Debt as a Percentage of GDP, 1942–2014 Federal debt is the sum of annual budget deficits

and surpluses. Annual deficits do not always mean that the debt/GDP ratio is rising. During the 1960s and 1970s,

the government often ran small deficits, but since the debt was growing more slowly than the economy, the debt/

GDP ratio was declining over this time. In the 2008–2009 recession, the debt/GDP ratio rose sharply, before leveling

off through the later 2010s. In 2020, it rose sharply again. (Source: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/

The next Clear it Up feature discusses how the government handles the national debt.

What is the national debt?
One year’s federal budget deficit causes the federal government to sell Treasury bonds to make up the difference

between spending programs and tax revenues. The dollar value of all the outstanding Treasury bonds on which the

federal government owes money is equal to the national debt.

The Path from Deficits to Surpluses to Deficits

Why did the budget deficits suddenly turn to surpluses from 1998 to 2001 and why did the surpluses return to

deficits in 2002? Why did the deficit become so large in 2020? Figure 17.9 suggests some answers. The graph

combines the earlier information on total federal spending and taxes in a single graph, but focuses on the

federal budget since 1990.

FIGURE 17.9 Total Government Spending and Taxes as a Share of GDP, 1990–2014 When government spending

exceeds taxes, the gap is the budget deficit. When taxes exceed spending, the gap is a budget surplus. The

recessionary period starting in late 2007 saw higher spending and lower taxes, combining to create a large deficit in

2009. The same thing happened in a more extreme way in 2020. (Source: Economic Report of the President, Tables

B-46, https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/erp/2021)

Government spending as a share of GDP declined steadily through the 1990s. The biggest single reason was

that defense spending declined from 5.2% of GDP in 1990 to 3.0% in 2000, but interest payments by the

federal government also fell by about 1.0% of GDP. However, federal tax collections increased substantially in

the later 1990s, jumping from 18.1% of GDP in 1994 to 20.8% in 2000. Powerful economic growth in the late

1990s fueled the boom in taxes. Personal income taxes rise as income goes up; payroll taxes rise as jobs and

payrolls go up; corporate income taxes rise as profits go up. At the same time, government spending on

transfer payments such as unemployment benefits, foods stamps, and welfare declined with more people

working.

This sharp increase in tax revenues and decrease in expenditures on transfer payments was largely

unexpected even by experienced budget analysts, and so budget surpluses came as a surprise. However, in the

early 2000s, many of these factors started running in reverse. Tax revenues sagged, due largely to the

recession that started in March 2001, which reduced revenues. Congress enacted a series of tax cuts and

President George W. Bush signed them into law, starting in 2001. In addition, government spending swelled

due to increases in defense, healthcare, education, Social Security, and support programs for those who were

hurt by the recession and the slow growth that followed. Deficits returned. When the severe recession hit in

late 2007, spending climbed and tax collections fell to historically unusual levels, resulting in enormous

deficits.

Longer-term U.S. budget forecasts, a decade or more into the future, predict enormous deficits. The higher

deficits during the 2007–2009 Great Recession and the 2020 pandemic-induced recession have repercussions,

and the demographics will be challenging. The primary reason is the “baby boom”—the exceptionally high

birthrates that began in 1946, right after World War II, and lasted for about two decades. Starting in 2010, the

17.4 • Using Fiscal Policy to Fight Recession, Unemployment, and Inflation 423

front edge of the baby boom generation reached age 65, and in the next two decades, the proportion of

Americans over the age of 65 will increase substantially. During the 2020 recession, we saw another wave of

early retirements, and we are now in the middle of this major demographic shift. The current level of the

payroll taxes that support Social Security and Medicare will fall well short of the projected expenses of these

programs, as the following Clear It Up feature shows; thus, the forecast is for increasingly large budget deficits.

A decision to collect more revenue to support these programs or to decrease benefit levels would alter this

long-term forecast.

CLEAR IT UP

What is the long-term budget outlook for Social Security and Medicare?
In 1946, just one American in 13 was over age 65. By 2000, it was one in eight. By 2030, one American in five will

be over age 65. Two enormous U.S. federal programs focus on the elderly—Social Security and Medicare. The

growing numbers of elderly Americans will increase spending on these programs, as well as on Medicaid. The

current payroll tax levied on workers, which supports all of Social Security and the hospitalization insurance part of

Medicare, will not be enough to cover the expected costs, so what are the options?

Long-term projections from the Congressional Budget Office in 2021 are that Medicare and Social Security spending

combined will rise from 8.7% of GDP in 2021 to about 10.8% by 2027–2031. If this rise in spending occurs, without

any corresponding rise in tax collections, then some mix of changes must occur: (1) taxes will need to increase

dramatically; (2) other spending will need to be cut dramatically; (3) the retirement age and/or age receiving

Medicare benefits will need to increase, or (4) the federal government will need to run extremely large budget

deficits.

Some proposals suggest removing the cap on wages subject to the payroll tax, so that those with very high incomes

would have to pay the tax on the entire amount of their wages. Other proposals suggest moving Social Security and

Medicare from systems in which workers pay for retirees toward programs that set up accounts where workers save

funds over their lifetimes and then draw out after retirement to pay for healthcare.

The United States is not alone in this problem. Providing the promised level of retirement and health benefits to a

growing proportion of elderly with a falling proportion of workers is an even more severe problem in many European

nations and in Japan. How to pay promised levels of benefits to the elderly will be a difficult public policy decision.

In the next module we shift to the use of fiscal policy to counteract business cycle fluctuations. In addition, we

will explore proposals requiring a balanced budget—that is, for government spending and taxes to be equal

each year. The Impacts of Government Borrowing will also cover how fiscal policy and government borrowing

will affect national saving—and thus affect economic growth and trade imbalances.

17.4 Using Fiscal Policy to Fight Recession, Unemployment, and Inflation

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain how expansionary fiscal policy can shift aggregate demand and influence the economy

• Explain how contractionary fiscal policy can shift aggregate demand and influence the economy

Fiscal policy is the use of government spending and tax policy to influence the path of the economy over time.

Graphically, we see that fiscal policy, whether through changes in spending or taxes, shifts the aggregate

demand outward in the case of expansionary fiscal policy and inward in the case of contractionary fiscal

policy. We know from the chapter on economic growth that over time the quantity and quality of our resources

grow as the population and thus the labor force get larger, as businesses invest in new capital, and as

technology improves. The result of this is regular shifts to the right of the aggregate supply curves, as Figure

17.10 illustrates.

424 17 • Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy

The original equilibrium occurs at E0, the intersection of aggregate demand curve AD0 and aggregate supply
curve SRAS0, at an output level of 200 and a price level of 90. One year later, aggregate supply has shifted to the
right to SRAS1 in the process of long-term economic growth, and aggregate demand has also shifted to the
right to AD1, keeping the economy operating at the new level of potential GDP. The new equilibrium (E1) is an
output level of 206 and a price level of 92. One more year later, aggregate supply has again shifted to the right,
now to SRAS2, and aggregate demand shifts right as well to AD2. Now the equilibrium is E2, with an output level
of 212 and a price level of 94. In short, the figure shows an economy that is growing steadily year to year,

producing at its potential GDP each year, with only small inflationary increases in the price level.

FIGURE 17.10 A Healthy, Growing Economy In this well-functioning economy, each year aggregate supply and
aggregate demand shift to the right so that the economy proceeds from equilibrium E0 to E1 to E2. Each year, the
economy produces at potential GDP with only a small inflationary increase in the price level. However, if aggregate

demand does not smoothly shift to the right and match increases in aggregate supply, growth with deflation can

develop.

Aggregate demand and aggregate supply do not always move neatly together. Think about what causes shifts in

aggregate demand over time. As aggregate supply increases, incomes tend to go up. This tends to increase

consumer and investment spending, shifting the aggregate demand curve to the right, but in any given period

it may not shift the same amount as aggregate supply. What happens to government spending and taxes?

Government spends to pay for the ordinary business of government- items such as national defense, social

security, and healthcare, as Figure 17.10 shows. Tax revenues, in part, pay for these expenditures. The result

may be an increase in aggregate demand more than or less than the increase in aggregate supply. Aggregate

demand may fail to increase along with aggregate supply, or aggregate demand may even shift left, for a

number of possible reasons: households become hesitant about consuming; firms decide against investing as

much; or perhaps the demand from other countries for exports diminishes.

For example, investment by private firms in physical capital in the U.S. economy boomed during the late

1990s, rising from 14.1% of GDP in 1993 to 17.2% in 2000, before falling back to 15.2% by 2002. Conversely, if

shifts in aggregate demand run ahead of increases in aggregate supply, inflationary increases in the price level

will result. Business cycles of recession and recovery are the consequence of shifts in aggregate supply and

aggregate demand. As these occur, the government may choose to use fiscal policy to address the difference.

Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation shows us that a central bank can use its powers over the banking system

to engage in countercyclical—or “against the business cycle”—actions. If recession threatens, the central bank

uses an expansionary monetary policy to increase the money supply, increase the quantity of loans, reduce

interest rates, and shift aggregate demand to the right. If inflation threatens, the central bank uses

contractionary monetary policy to reduce the money supply, reduce the quantity of loans, raise interest rates,

17.4 • Using Fiscal Policy to Fight Recession, Unemployment, and Inflation 425

and shift aggregate demand to the left. Fiscal policy is another macroeconomic policy tool for adjusting

aggregate demand by using either government spending or taxation policy.

Expansionary Fiscal Policy

Expansionary fiscal policy increases the level of aggregate demand, through either increases in government

spending or reductions in tax rates. Expansionary policy can do this by (1) increasing consumption by raising

disposable income through cuts in personal income taxes or payroll taxes; (2) increasing investment spending

by raising after-tax profits through cuts in business taxes; and (3) increasing government purchases through

increased federal government spending on final goods and services and raising federal grants to state and

local governments to increase their expenditures on final goods and services. Contractionary fiscal policy does

the reverse: it decreases the level of aggregate demand by decreasing consumption, decreasing investment,

and decreasing government spending, either through cuts in government spending or increases in taxes. The

aggregate demand/aggregate supply model is useful in judging whether expansionary or contractionary fiscal

policy is appropriate.

Consider first the situation in Figure 17.11, which is similar to the U.S. economy during the 2007-2009
recession. The intersection of aggregate demand (AD0) and aggregate supply (SRAS0) is occurring below the
level of potential GDP as the LRAS curve indicates. At the equilibrium (E0), a recession occurs and
unemployment rises. In this case, expansionary fiscal policy using tax cuts or increases in government
spending can shift aggregate demand to AD1, closer to the full-employment level of output. In addition, the
price level would rise back to the level P1 associated with potential GDP.

FIGURE 17.11 Expansionary Fiscal Policy The original equilibrium (E0) represents a recession, occurring at a
quantity of output (Y0) below potential GDP. However, a shift of aggregate demand from AD0 to AD1, enacted
through an expansionary fiscal policy, can move the economy to a new equilibrium output of E1 at the level of
potential GDP which the LRAS curve shows. Since the economy was originally producing below potential GDP, any
inflationary increase in the price level from P0 to P1 that results should be relatively small.

Should the government use tax cuts or spending increases, or a mix of the two, to carry out expansionary fiscal

policy? During the 2007-2009 Great Recession, the U.S. economy suffered a 3.1% cumulative loss of GDP. That

may not sound like much, but it’s more than one year’s average growth rate of GDP. Over that time frame, the

unemployment rate doubled from 5% to 10%. The choice between whether to use tax or spending tools often

has a political tinge. As a general statement, conservatives and Republicans prefer to see expansionary fiscal

policy carried out by tax cuts, while liberals and Democrats prefer that the government implement

expansionary fiscal policy through spending increases. In a bipartisan effort to address the extreme situation,

the Obama administration and Congress passed an $830 billion expansionary policy in early 2009 involving

both tax cuts and increases in government spending. At the same time, however, the federal stimulus was

426 17 • Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy

partially offset when state and local governments, whose budgets were hard hit by the recession, began cutting

their spending.

Events were even more severe during the more recent pandemic-induced recession. In a single quarter

(Quarter 2 of 2020), GDP fell by over 9%, or at an annualized rate of about 34%. Policymakers were quick to

respond with expanded unemployment insurance, aid to state and local governments (so that they didn’t have

to cut their spending like they did during the Great Recession), grants and tax breaks for small businesses, and

perhaps most significantly, stimulus checks sent to over 100 million households, totaling thousands of dollars

each. Since these were mostly spending measures, they were supported more by Democrats than by

Republicans, although both groups recognized the severity of the problem and were largely in agreement early

on. Especially during the debates over later rounds of the stimulus checks, many discussions were had over

the appropriate size and target of the checks. Ultimately, compromises were made and no side got exactly what

it wanted.

The conflict over which policy tool to use can be frustrating to those who want to categorize economics as

“liberal” or “conservative,” or who want to use economic models to argue against their political opponents.

However, advocates of smaller government, who seek to reduce taxes and government spending can use the
AD AS model, as well as advocates of bigger government, who seek to raise taxes and government spending.
Economic studies of specific taxing and spending programs can help inform decisions about whether the

government should change taxes or spending, and in what ways. Ultimately, decisions about whether to use tax

or spending mechanisms to implement macroeconomic policy is a political decision rather than a purely

economic one.

Contractionary Fiscal Policy

Fiscal policy can also contribute to pushing aggregate demand beyond potential GDP in a way that leads to

inflation. As Figure 17.12 shows, a very large budget deficit pushes up aggregate demand, so that the
intersection of aggregate demand (AD0) and aggregate supply (SRAS0) occurs at equilibrium E0, which is an
output level above potential GDP. Economists sometimes call this an “overheating economy” where demand is

so high that there is upward pressure on wages and prices, causing inflation. In this situation, contractionary

fiscal policy involving federal spending cuts or tax increases can help to reduce the upward pressure on the
price level by shifting aggregate demand to the left, to AD1, and causing the new equilibrium E1 to be at
potential GDP, where aggregate demand intersects the LRAS curve.

FIGURE 17.12 A Contractionary Fiscal Policy The economy starts at the equilibrium quantity of output Y0, which is
above potential GDP. The extremely high level of aggregate demand will generate inflationary increases in the price
level. A contractionary fiscal policy can shift aggregate demand down from AD0 to AD1, leading to a new equilibrium

output E1, which occurs at potential GDP, where AD1 intersects the LRAS curve.

Again, the AD–AS model does not dictate how the government should carry out this contractionary fiscal

policy. Some may prefer spending cuts; others may prefer tax increases; still others may say that it depends on

the specific situation. The model only argues that, in this situation, the government needs to reduce aggregate

demand.

17.5 Automatic Stabilizers

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Describe how the federal government can use discretionary fiscal policy to stabilize the economy

•

Identify examples of automatic stabilizers

• Understand how a government can use standardized employment budget to identify automatic stabilizers

In 2020, more than 20 million people could collect unemployment insurance benefits to replace some of their

salaries. Federal fiscal policies include discretionary fiscal policy, when the government passes a new law

that explicitly changes tax or spending levels. The 2020 stimulus checks and increases in state and local

government aid are an example. Changes in tax and spending levels can also occur automatically, due to
automatic stabilizers, such as unemployment insurance and food stamps, which are programs that are

already laws that stimulate aggregate demand in a recession and hold down aggregate demand in a potentially

inflationary boom.

Counterbalancing Recession and Boom

Consider first the situation where aggregate demand has risen sharply, causing the equilibrium to occur at a

level of output above potential GDP. This situation will increase inflationary pressure in the economy. The

policy prescription in this setting would be a dose of contractionary fiscal policy, implemented through some

combination of higher taxes and lower spending. To some extent, bothchanges happen automatically. On the

tax side, a rise in aggregate demand means that workers and firms throughout the economy earn more.

Because taxes are based on personal income and corporate profits, a rise in aggregate demand automatically

increases tax payments. On the spending side, stronger aggregate demand typically means lower

unemployment and fewer layoffs, and so there is less need for government spending on unemployment

benefits, welfare, Medicaid, and other programs in the social safety net.

The process works in reverse, too. If aggregate demand were to fall sharply so that a recession occurs, then the

prescription would be for expansionary fiscal policy—some mix of tax cuts and spending increases. The lower

level of aggregate demand and higher unemployment will tend to pull down personal incomes and corporate

profits, an effect that will reduce the amount of taxes owed automatically. Higher unemployment and a weaker
economy should lead to increased government spending on unemployment benefits, welfare, and other

similar domestic programs. In 2009, the stimulus package included an extension in the time allowed to collect

unemployment insurance. In addition, the automatic stabilizers react to a weakening of aggregate demand

with expansionary fiscal policy and react to a strengthening of aggregate demand with contractionary fiscal

policy, just as the AD/AS analysis suggests.

A combination of automatic stabilizers and discretionary fiscal policy produced the very large budget deficit in

2020. The pandemic caused high levels of unemployment, meaning less tax-generating economic activity. The

high unemployment rate triggered the automatic stabilizers that reduce taxes and increase spending, due to

the increased amount of unemployment insurance paid out by the federal and state governments. Most

economists, even those who are concerned about a possible pattern of persistently large budget deficits, are

much less concerned or even quite supportive of larger budget deficits in the short run of a few years during

and immediately after a severe recession.

A glance back at economic history provides a second illustration of the power of automatic stabilizers.

428 17 • Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy

Remember that the length of economic upswings between recessions has become longer in the U.S. economy

in recent decades (as we discussed in Unemployment). The three longest economic booms of the twentieth

century happened in the 1960s, the 1980s, and the 1991–2001 time period. One reason why the economy has

tipped into recession less frequently in recent decades is that the size of government spending and taxes has

increased in the second half of the twentieth century. Thus, the automatic stabilizing effects from spending

and taxes are now larger than they were in the first half of the twentieth century. Around 1900, for example,

federal spending was only about 2% of GDP. In 1929, just before the Great Depression hit, government

spending was still just 4% of GDP. In those earlier times, the smaller size of government made automatic

stabilizers far less powerful than in the last few decades, when government spending often hovers at 20% of

GDP or more.

The Standardized Employment Deficit or Surplus

Each year, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculates the standardized employment

budget—that is, what the budget deficit or surplus would be if the economy were producing at potential GDP,

where people who look for work were finding jobs in a reasonable period of time and businesses were making

normal profits, with the result that both workers and businesses would be earning more and paying more
taxes. In effect, the standardized employment deficit eliminates the impact of the automatic stabilizers. Figure
17.13 compares the actual budget deficits of recent decades with the CBO’s standardized deficit.

FIGURE 17.13 Comparison of Actual Budget Deficits with the Standardized Employment Deficit When the economy

is in recession, the standardized employment budget deficit is less than the actual budget deficit because the

economy is below potential GDP, and the automatic stabilizers are reducing taxes and increasing spending. When

the economy is performing extremely well, the standardized employment deficit (or surplus) is higher than the

actual budget deficit (or surplus) because the economy is producing about potential GDP, so the automatic

stabilizers are increasing taxes and reducing the need for government spending. (Sources: Actual and Cyclically

Adjusted Budget Surpluses/Deficits,https://www.cbo.gov/data/budget-economic-data#8)

Notice that in recession years, like the early 1990s, 2001, or 2009, the standardized employment deficit is

smaller than the actual deficit. (These data are only available up until February 2020, so they do not include

the effects of the pandemic.) During recessions, the automatic stabilizers tend to increase the budget deficit, so

if the economy was instead at full employment, the deficit would be reduced. However, in the late 1990s the

standardized employment budget surplus was lower than the actual budget surplus. The gap between the

standardized budget deficit or surplus and the actual budget deficit or surplus shows the impact of the

automatic stabilizers. More generally, the standardized budget figures allow you to see what the budget deficit

would look like with the economy held constant—at its potential GDP level of output.

Automatic stabilizers occur quickly. Lower wages means that a lower amount of taxes is withheld from

paychecks right away. Higher unemployment or poverty means that government spending in those areas rises

as quickly as people apply for benefits. However, while the automatic stabilizers offset part of the shifts in

aggregate demand, they do not offset all or even most of it. Historically, automatic stabilizers on the tax and

spending side offset about 10% of any initial movement in the level of output. This offset may not seem

enormous, but it is still useful. Automatic stabilizers, like shock absorbers in a car, can be useful if they reduce

the impact of the worst bumps, even if they do not eliminate the bumps altogether.

Child Tax Credit

One new form of government spending meant to support working families is an expanded Child Tax Credit

(CTC). Under changes which took effect in 2021, qualifying families will receive the credit as a monthly

payment directly into their bank accounts. The credit is also an expanded amount: from $2,000 per child to

$3,600 per child under the age of 6 (less for children older than that). Introduced by President Joe Biden’s

American Rescue Plan, it is hoped that the newly expanded CTC will help reduce child poverty and support

families. Because the CTC works like a grant that is automatically extended to households, the CTC is

considered a new kind of fiscal policy that is related to a universal basic income policy which some have

argued for in the past. By sending money out monthly instead of a lump sum as part of a person’s tax refund,

the intention is to help families better manage monthly bills for things like clothes and food.

17.6 Practical Problems with Discretionary Fiscal Policy

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Understand how fiscal policy and monetary policy are interconnected

• Explain the three lag times that often occur when solving economic problems

•

Identify the legal and political challenges of responding to an economic problem

In the early 1960s, many leading economists believed that the problem of the business cycle, and the swings

between cyclical unemployment and inflation, were a thing of the past. On the cover of its December 31, 1965,

issue, Timemagazine, then the premier news magazine in the United States, ran a picture of John Maynard

Keynes, and the story inside identified Keynesian theories as “the prime influence on the world’s economies.”

The article reported that policymakers have “used Keynesian principles not only to avoid the violent [business]

cycles of prewar days but to produce phenomenal economic growth and to achieve remarkably stable prices.”

This happy consensus, however, did not last. The U.S. economy suffered one recession from December 1969 to

November 1970, a deeper recession from November 1973 to March 1975, and then double-dip recessions
from January to June 1980 and from July 1981 to November 1982. At various times, inflation and

unemployment both soared. Clearly, the problems of macroeconomic policy had not been completely solved.

As economists began to consider what had gone wrong, they identified a number of issues that make

discretionary fiscal policy more difficult than it had seemed in the rosy optimism of the mid-1960s.

Fiscal Policy and Interest Rates

Because fiscal policy affects the quantity that the government borrows in financial capital markets, it not only
affects aggregate demand—it can also affect interest rates. In Figure 17.14, the original equilibrium (E0) in the
financial capital market occurs at a quantity of $800 billion and an interest rate of 6%. However, an increase in
government budget deficits shifts the demand for financial capital from D0 to D1. The new equilibrium (E1)
occurs at a quantity of $900 billion and an interest rate of 7%.

A consensus estimate based on a number of studies is that an increase in budget deficits (or a fall in budget

surplus) by 1% of GDP will cause an increase of 0.5–1.0% in the long-term interest rate.

430 17 • Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy

FIGURE 17.14 Fiscal Policy and Interest Rates When a government borrows money in the financial capital market, it
causes a shift in the demand for financial capital from D0 to D1. As the equilibrium moves from E0 to E1, the
equilibrium interest rate rises from 6% to 7% in this example. In this way, an expansionary fiscal policy intended to

shift aggregate demand to the right can also lead to a higher interest rate, which has the effect of shifting aggregate

demand back to the left.

A problem arises here. An expansionary fiscal policy, with tax cuts or spending increases, is intended to

increase aggregate demand. If an expansionary fiscal policy also causes higher interest rates, then firms and

households are discouraged from borrowing and spending (as occurs with tight monetary policy), thus

reducing aggregate demand. Even if the direct effect of expansionary fiscal policy on increasing demand is not

totally offset by lower aggregate demand from higher interest rates, fiscal policy can end up less powerful than

was originally expected. We refer to this as crowding out, where government borrowing and spending results

in higher interest rates, which reduces business investment and household consumption.

The broader lesson is that the government must coordinate fiscal and monetary policy. If expansionary fiscal

policy is to work well, then the central bank can also reduce or keep short-term interest rates low. Conversely,

monetary policy can also help to ensure that contractionary fiscal policy does not lead to a recession.

Long and Variable Time Lags

The government can change monetary policy several times each year, but it takes much longer to enact fiscal

policy. Imagine that the economy starts to slow down. It often takes some months before the economic
statistics signal clearly that a downturn has started, and a few months more to confirm that it is truly a

recession and not just a one- or two-month blip. Economists often call the time it takes to determine that a

recession has occurred the recognition lag. After this lag, policymakers become aware of the problem and

propose fiscal policy bills. The bills go into various congressional committees for hearings, negotiations, votes,

and then, if passed, eventually for the president’s signature. Many fiscal policy bills about spending or taxes

propose changes that would start in the next budget year or would be phased in gradually over time.

Economists often refer to the time it takes to pass a bill as the legislative lag. Finally, once the government

passes the bill it takes some time to disperse the funds to the appropriate agencies to implement the programs.

Economists call the time it takes to start the projects the implementation lag.

Moreover, the exact level of fiscal policy that the government should implement is never completely clear.

Should it increase the budget deficit by 0.5% of GDP? By 1% of GDP? By 2% of GDP? In an AD/AS diagram, it is

straightforward to sketch an aggregate demand curve shifting to the potential GDP level of output. In the real

world, we only know roughly, not precisely, the actual level of potential output, and exactly how a spending cut

or tax increase will affect aggregate demand is always somewhat controversial. Also unknown is the state of the

Access for free at openstax.org

17.6 • Practical Problems with Discretionary Fiscal Policy 431

economy at any point in time. During the early days of the Obama administration, for example, no one knew

the true extent of the economy's deficit. During the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the rapid collapse of the

banking system and automotive sector made it difficult to assess how quickly the economy was collapsing.

Thus, it can take many months or even more than a year to begin an expansionary fiscal policy after a

recession has started—and even then, uncertainty will remain over exactly how much to expand or contract

taxes and spending. When politicians attempt to use countercyclical fiscal policy to fight recession or inflation,

they run the risk of responding to the macroeconomic situation of two or three years ago, in a way that may be

exactly wrong for the economy at that time. George P. Schultz, a professor of economics, former Secretary of

the Treasury, and Director of the Office of Management and Budget, once wrote: “While the economist is

accustomed to the concept of lags, the politician likes instant results. The tension comes because, as I have

seen on many occasions, the economist’s lag is the politician’s nightmare.”

Temporary and Permanent Fiscal Policy

A temporary tax cut or spending increase will explicitly last only for a year or two, and then revert to its

original level. A permanent tax cut or spending increase is expected to stay in place for the foreseeable future.

The effect of temporary and permanent fiscal policies on aggregate demand can be very different. Consider

how you would react if the government announced a tax cut that would last one year and then be repealed, in

comparison with how you would react if the government announced a permanent tax cut. Most people and

firms will react more strongly to a permanent policy change than a temporary one.

This fact creates an unavoidable difficulty for countercyclical fiscal policy. The appropriate policy may be to

have an expansionary fiscal policy with large budget deficits during a recession, and then a contractionary

fiscal policy with budget surpluses when the economy is growing well. However, if both policies are explicitly

temporary ones, they will have a less powerful effect than a permanent policy.

Structural Economic Change Takes Time

When an economy recovers from a recession, it does not usually revert to its exact earlier shape. Instead, the

economy's internal structure evolves and changes and this process can take time. For example, much of the

economic growth of the mid-2000s was in the construction sector (especially of housing) and finance.

However, when housing prices started falling in 2007 and the resulting financial crunch led into recession (as

we discussed in Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation), both sectors contracted. The manufacturing sector of

the U.S. economy has been losing jobs in recent years as well, under pressure from technological change and

foreign competition. Many of the people who lost work from these sectors in the 2008-2009 Great Recession

will never return to the same jobs in the same sectors of the economy. Instead, the economy will need to grow

in new and different directions, as the following Clear It Up feature shows. Fiscal policy can increase overall

demand, but the process of structural economic change—the expansion of a new set of industries and the

movement of workers to those industries—inevitably takes time.

CLEAR IT UP

Why do jobs vanish?
People can lose jobs for a variety of reasons: because of a recession, but also because of longer-run changes in the

economy, such as new technology. Productivity improvements in auto manufacturing, for example, can reduce the

number of workers needed, and eliminate these jobs in the long run. The internet has created jobs but also caused

job loss, from travel agents to book store clerks. Many of these jobs may never come back. Short-run fiscal policy to
reduce unemployment can create jobs, but it cannot replace jobs that will never return.

The Limitations of Fiscal Policy

Fiscal policy can help an economy that is producing below its potential GDP to expand aggregate demand so

432 17 • Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy

that it produces closer to potential GDP, thus lowering unemployment. However, fiscal policy cannot help an

economy produce at an output level above potential GDP without causing inflation At this point,

unemployment becomes so low that workers become scarce and wages rise rapidly.

Political Realties and Discretionary Fiscal Policy

A final problem for discretionary fiscal policy arises out of the difficulties of explaining to politicians how

countercyclical fiscal policy that runs against the tide of the business cycle should work. Some politicians have

a gut-level belief that when the economy and tax revenues slow down, it is time to hunker down, pinch

pennies, and trim expenses. Countercyclical policy, however, says that when the economy has slowed, it is time

for the government to stimulate the economy, raising spending, and cutting taxes. This offsets the drop in the

economy in the other sectors. Conversely, when economic times are good and tax revenues are rolling in,

politicians often feel that it is time for tax cuts and new spending. However, countercyclical policy says that

this economic boom should be an appropriate time for keeping taxes high and restraining spending.

Politicians tend to prefer expansionary fiscal policy over contractionary policy. There is rarely a shortage of

proposals for tax cuts and spending increases, especially during recessions. However, politicians are less

willing to hear the message that in good economic times, they should propose tax increases and spending

limits. In the economic upswing of the late 1990s and early 2000s, for example, the U.S. GDP grew rapidly.

Estimates from respected government economic forecasters like the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office

and the Office of Management and Budget stated that the GDP was above potential GDP, and that

unemployment rates were unsustainably low. However, no mainstream politician took the lead in saying that

the booming economic times might be an appropriate time for spending cuts or tax increases.

Discretionary Fiscal Policy: Summing Up

Expansionary fiscal policy can help to end recessions and contractionary fiscal policy can help to reduce

inflation. Given the uncertainties over interest rate effects, time lags, temporary and permanent policies, and

unpredictable political behavior, many economists and knowledgeable policymakers had concluded by the

mid-1990s that discretionary fiscal policy was a blunt instrument, more like a club than a scalpel. It might still

make sense to use it in extreme economic situations, like an especially deep or long recession. For less

extreme situations, it was often preferable to let fiscal policy work through the automatic stabilizers and focus

on monetary policy to steer short-term countercyclical efforts.

17.7 The Question of a Balanced Budget

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Understand the arguments for and against requiring the U.S. federal budget to be balanced

• Consider the long-run and short-run effects of a federal budget deficit

For many decades, going back to the 1930s, various legislators have put forward proposals to require that the

U.S. government balance its budget every year. In 1995, a proposed constitutional amendment that would

require a balanced budget passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a wide margin, and failed in the U.S.

Senate by only a single vote. (For the balanced budget to have become an amendment to the Constitution

would have required a two-thirds vote by Congress and passage by three-quarters of the state legislatures.)

Most economists view the proposals for a perpetually balanced budget with bemusement. After all, in the short

term, economists would expect the budget deficits and surpluses to fluctuate up and down with the economy

and the automatic stabilizers. Economic recessions should automatically lead to larger budget deficits or

Access for free at openstax.org

17.7 • The Question of a Balanced Budget 433

smaller budget surpluses, while economic booms lead to smaller deficits or larger surpluses. A requirement

that the budget be balanced each and every year would prevent these automatic stabilizers from working and

would worsen the severity of economic fluctuations.

Some supporters of the balanced budget amendment like to argue that, since households must balance their

own budgets, the government should too. However, this analogy between household and government behavior

is severely flawed. Most households do not balance their budgets every year. Some years households borrow to

buy houses or cars or to pay for medical expenses or college tuition. Other years they repay loans and save

funds in retirement accounts. After retirement, they withdraw and spend those savings. Also, the government

is not a household for many reasons, one of which is that the government has macroeconomic responsibilities.

The argument of Keynesian macroeconomic policy is that the government needs to lean against the wind,

spending when times are hard and saving when times are good, for the sake of the overall economy.

There is also no particular reason to expect a government budget to be balanced in the medium term of a few

years. For example, a government may decide that by running large budget deficits, it can make crucial long-

term investments in human capital and physical infrastructure that will build the country's long-term

productivity. These decisions may work out well or poorly, but they are not always irrational. Such policies of
ongoing government budget deficits may persist for decades. As the U.S. experience from the end of World War
II up to about 1980 shows, it is perfectly possible to run budget deficits almost every year for decades, but as

long as the percentage increases in debt are smaller than the percentage growth of GDP, the debt/GDP ratio will

decline at the same time.

Nothing in this argument is a claim that budget deficits are always a wise policy. In the short run, a

government that runs a very large budget deficit can shift aggregate demand to the right and trigger severe

inflation. Additionally, governments may borrow for foolish or impractical reasons. The Impacts of

Government Borrowing will discuss how large budget deficits, by reducing national saving, can in certain cases

reduce economic growth and even contribute to international financial crises. A requirement that the budget

be balanced in each calendar year, however, is a misguided overreaction to the fear that in some cases, budget

deficits can become too large.

BRING IT HOME

No Yellowstone Park?
The 2013 federal budget shutdown illustrated the many sides to fiscal policy and the federal budget. In 2013,

Republicans and Democrats could not agree on which spending policies to fund and how large the government debt

should be. Due to the severity of the 2008-2009 recession, the fiscal stimulus, and previous policies, the federal

budget deficit and debt was historically high. One way to try to cut federal spending and borrowing was to refuse to

raise the legal federal debt limit, or tie on conditions to appropriation bills to stop the Affordable Health Care Act.

This disagreement led to a two-week federal government shutdown and got close to the deadline where the federal

government would default on its Treasury bonds. Finally, however, a compromise emerged and the government

avoided default. This shows clearly how closely fiscal policies are tied to politics.

Key Concepts and Summary

17.1 Government Spending

Fiscal policy is the set of policies that relate to federal government spending, taxation, and borrowing. In

recent decades, the level of federal government spending and taxes, expressed as a share of GDP, has not

changed much, typically fluctuating between about 18% to 22% of GDP. However, the level of state spending

and taxes, as a share of GDP, has risen from about 12–13% to about 20% of GDP over the last four decades. The

four main areas of federal spending are national defense, Social Security, healthcare, and interest payments,

which together account for about 70% of all federal spending. When a government spends more than it collects

in taxes, it is said to have a budget deficit. When a government collects more in taxes than it spends, it is said to

have a budget surplus. If government spending and taxes are equal, it is said to have a balanced budget. The
sum of all past deficits and surpluses make up the government debt.

17.2 Taxation

The two main federal taxes are individual income taxes and payroll taxes that provide funds for Social Security

and Medicare; these taxes together account for more than 80% of federal revenues. Other federal taxes include

Access for free at openstax.org

17 • Key Concepts and Summary 435

the corporate income tax, excise taxes on alcohol, gasoline and tobacco, and the estate and gift tax. A

progressive tax is one, like the federal income tax, where those with higher incomes pay a higher share of taxes

out of their income than those with lower incomes. A proportional tax is one, like the payroll tax for Medicare,

where everyone pays the same share of taxes regardless of income level. A regressive tax is one, like the payroll

tax (above a certain threshold) that supports Social Security, where those with high income pay a lower share

of income in taxes than those with lower incomes.

17.3 Federal Deficits and the National Debt

For most of the twentieth century, the U.S. government took on debt during wartime and then paid down that

debt slowly in peacetime. However, it took on quite substantial debts in peacetime in the 1980s and early

1990s, before a brief period of budget surpluses from 1998 to 2001, followed by a return to annual budget

deficits since 2002, with very large deficits in the recession of 2008 and 2009. A budget deficit or budget

surplus is measured annually. Total government debt or national debt is the sum of budget deficits and budget

surpluses over time.

17.4 Using Fiscal Policy to Fight Recession, Unemployment, and Inflation

Expansionary fiscal policy increases the level of aggregate demand, either through increases in government
spending or through reductions in taxes. Expansionary fiscal policy is most appropriate when an economy is

in recession and producing below its potential GDP. Contractionary fiscal policy decreases the level of

aggregate demand, either through cuts in government spending or increases in taxes. Contractionary fiscal

policy is most appropriate when an economy is producing above its potential GDP.

17.5 Automatic Stabilizers

Fiscal policy is conducted both through discretionary fiscal policy, which occurs when the government enacts

taxation or spending changes in response to economic events, or through automatic stabilizers, which are

taxing and spending mechanisms that, by their design, shift in response to economic events without any

further legislation. The standardized employment budget is the calculation of what the budget deficit or budget

surplus would have been in a given year if the economy had been producing at its potential GDP in that year.

Many economists and politicians criticize the use of fiscal policy for a variety of reasons, including concerns

over time lags, the impact on interest rates, and the inherently political nature of fiscal policy. We cover the

critique of fiscal policy in the next module.

17.6 Practical Problems with Discretionary Fiscal Policy

Because fiscal policy affects the quantity of money that the government borrows in financial capital markets, it

not only affects aggregate demand—it can also affect interest rates. If an expansionary fiscal policy also causes

higher interest rates, then firms and households are discouraged from borrowing and spending, reducing

aggregate demand in a situation called crowding out. Given the uncertainties over interest rate effects, time

lags (implementation lag, legislative lag, and recognition lag), temporary and permanent policies, and

unpredictable political behavior, many economists and knowledgeable policymakers have concluded that

discretionary fiscal policy is a blunt instrument and better used only in extreme situations.

17.7 The Question of a Balanced Budget

Balanced budget amendments are a popular political idea, but the economic merits behind such proposals are

questionable. Most economists accept that fiscal policy needs to be flexible enough to accommodate

unforeseen expenditures, such as wars or recessions. While persistent, large budget deficits can indeed be a

problem, a balanced budget amendment prevents even small, temporary deficits that might, in some cases, be

necessary.

Introduction to the Impacts of Government Borrowing

BRING IT HOME

Financing Higher Education
On November 8, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed The Higher Education Act of 1965 into law. With a

stroke of the pen, he implemented what we know as the financial aid, work study, and student loan programs to help

Americans pay for a college education. In his remarks, the President said:

Here the seeds were planted from which grew my firm conviction that for the individual, education is the

path to achievement and fulfillment; for the Nation, it is a path to a society that is not only free but civilized;

and for the world, it is the path to peace—for it is education that places reason over force.

This Act, he said, "is responsible for funding higher education for millions of Americans. It is the embodiment of the

United States’ investment in ‘human capital’." Since Johnson signed the Act into law, the government has renewed it

several times.

440 18 • The Impacts of Government Borrowing

The purpose of The Higher Education Act of 1965 was to build the country’s human capital by creating educational

opportunity for millions of Americans. The three criteria that the government uses to judge eligibility are income,

full-time or part-time attendance, and the cost of the institution. According to education.org, in the 2011–2012

school year, over 80% of all full-time college students received some form of federal financial aid; 43% received

grants; and another 41% of students aged 15–23 received federal government student loans. The budget to support

financial aid has increased not only because of more enrollment, but also because of increased tuition and fees for

higher education. In 2022, the government generally took an approach of increasing student aid through programs

such as Pell Grant expansion, while also taking steps to ease student loan debt.

Governments have many competing demands for financial support. Any spending should be tempered by

fiscal responsibility and by looking carefully at the spending’s impact. When a government spends more than

it collects in taxes, it runs a budget deficit. It then needs to borrow. When government borrowing becomes

especially large and sustained, it can substantially reduce the financial capital available to private sector firms,

as well as lead to trade imbalances and even financial crises.

The Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy chapter introduced the concepts of deficits and debt, as well as how

a government could use fiscal policy to address recession or inflation. This chapter begins by building on the
national savings and investment identity, which we first introduced in The International Trade and Capital

Flows chapter, to show how government borrowing affects firms’ physical capital investment levels and trade

balances. A prolonged period of budget deficits may lead to lower economic growth, in part because the funds

that the government borrows to fund its budget deficits are typically no longer available for private investment.

Moreover, a sustained pattern of large budget deficits can lead to disruptive economic patterns of high

inflation, substantial inflows of financial capital from abroad, plummeting exchange rates, and heavy strains

on a country’s banking and financial system.

18.1 How Government Borrowing Affects Investment and the Trade Balance

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain the national saving and investment identity in terms of demand and supply

• Evaluate the role of budget surpluses and trade surpluses in national saving and investment identity

When governments are borrowers in financial markets, there are three possible sources for the funds from a

macroeconomic point of view: (1) households might save more; (2) private firms might borrow less; and (3) the

additional funds for government borrowing might come from outside the country, from foreign financial

investors. Let’s begin with a review of why one of these three options must occur, and then explore how interest

rates and exchange rates adjust to these connections.

The National Saving and Investment Identity

The national saving and investment identity, which we first introduced in The International Trade and Capital

Flows chapter, provides a framework for showing the relationships between the sources of demand and supply

in financial capital markets. The identity begins with a statement that must always hold true: the quantity of

financial capital supplied in the market must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded.

The U.S. economy has two main sources for financial capital: private savings from inside the U.S. economy and

public savings.

These include the inflow of foreign financial capital from abroad. The inflow of savings from abroad is, by

definition, equal to the trade deficit, as we explained in The International Trade and Capital Flows chapter. We

can write this inflow of foreign investment capital as imports (M) minus exports (X). There are also two main

sources of demand for financial capital: private sector investment (I) and government borrowing. Government

18.1 • How Government Borrowing Affects Investment and the Trade Balance 441

borrowing in any given year is equal to the budget deficit, which we can write as the difference between

government spending (G) and net taxes (T). Let’s call this equation 1.

Governments often spend more than they receive in taxes and, therefore, public savings (T – G) is negative.

This causes a need to borrow money in the amount of (G – T) instead of adding to the nation’s savings. If this is

the case, we can view governments as demanders of financial capital instead of suppliers. In algebraic terms,

we can rewrite the national savings and investment identity like this:

Let’s call this equation 2. We must accompany a change in any part of the national saving and investment

identity by offsetting changes in at least one other part of the equation because we assume that the equality of

quantity supplied and quantity demanded always holds. If the government budget deficit changes, then either

private saving or investment or the trade balance—or some combination of the three—must change as well.

Figure 18.2 shows the possible effects.

FIGURE 18.2 Effects of Change in Budget Surplus or Deficit on Investment, Savings, and The Trade Balance Chart

(a) shows the potential results when the budget deficit rises (or budget surplus falls). Chart (b) shows the potential

results when the budget deficit falls (or budget surplus rises).

What about Budget Surpluses and Trade Surpluses?

The national saving and investment identity must always hold true because, by definition, the quantity
supplied and quantity demanded in the financial capital market must always be equal. However, the formula

will look somewhat different if the government budget is in deficit rather than surplus or if the balance of trade

is in surplus rather than deficit. For example, in 1999 and 2000, the U.S. government had budget surpluses,

although the economy was still experiencing trade deficits. When the government was running budget

surpluses, it was acting as a saver rather than a borrower, and supplying rather than demanding financial

capital. As a result, we would write the national saving and investment identity during this time as:

Let's call this equation 3. Notice that this expression is mathematically the same as equation 2 except the

savings and investment sides of the identity have simply flipped sides.

During the 1960s, the U.S. government was often running a budget deficit, but the economy was typically

running trade surpluses. Since a trade surplus means that an economy is experiencing a net outflow of

442 18 • The Impacts of Government Borrowing

financial capital, we would write the national saving and investment identity as:

Instead of the balance of trade representing part of the supply of financial capital, which occurs with a trade

deficit, a trade surplus represents an outflow of financial capital leaving the domestic economy and invested

elsewhere in the world.

We assume that the point to these equations is that the national saving and investment identity always hold.

When you write these relationships, it is important to engage your brain and think about what is on the supply

and demand side of the financial capital market before you start your calculations.

As you can see in Figure 18.3, the Office of Management and Budget shows that the United States has

consistently run budget deficits since 1977, with the exception of 1999 and 2000. What is alarming is the

dramatic increase in budget deficits that has occurred since 2008, which in part reflects declining tax

revenues and increased safety net expenditures due to the Great Recession. While deficits were controlled as

the economy began to recover in the mid-2010s, the budget deficit increased again in 2020 during the

pandemic, and forecasters expect deficits to remain high for the foreseeable future. (Recall that T is net taxes.

When the government must transfer funds back to individuals for safety net expenditures like Social Security

and unemployment benefits, budget deficits rise.) These deficits have implications for the future health of the

U.S. economy.

A rising budget deficit may result in a fall in domestic investment, a rise in private savings, or a rise in the

trade deficit. The following modules discuss each of these possible effects in more detail.

18.2 Fiscal Policy and the Trade Balance

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Discuss twin deficits as they related to budget and trade deficit

• Explain the relationship between budget deficits and exchange rates

• Explain the relationship between budget deficits and inflation

•

Identify causes of recessions

Government budget balances can affect the trade balance. As The Keynesian Perspective chapter discusses, a

net inflow of foreign financial investment always accompanies a trade deficit, while a net outflow of financial

investment always accompanies a trade surplus. One way to understand the connection from budget deficits to

trade deficits is that when government creates a budget deficit with some combination of tax cuts or spending
increases, it will increase aggregate demand in the economy, and some of that increase in aggregate demand

will result in a higher level of imports. A higher level of imports, with exports remaining fixed, will cause a

larger trade deficit. That means foreigners’ holdings of dollars increase as Americans purchase more imported

goods. Foreigners use those dollars to invest in the United States, which leads to an inflow of foreign

investment. One possible source of funding our budget deficit is foreigners buying Treasury securities that the

U.S. government sells, thus a trade deficit often accompanies a budget deficit.

Twin Deficits?

In the mid-1980s, it was common to hear economists and even newspaper articles refer to the twin deficits, as

the budget deficit and trade deficit both grew substantially. Figure 18.4 shows the pattern. The federal budget

deficit went from 2.6% of GDP in 1981 to 5.1% of GDP in 1985—a drop of 2.5% of GDP. Over that time, the trade

deficit moved from 0.5% in 1981 to 2.9% in 1985—a drop of 2.4% of GDP. In the mid-1980s an inflow of foreign

investment capital matched, the considerable increase in government borrowing, so the government budget

deficit and the trade deficit moved together.

FIGURE 18.4 U.S. Budget Deficits and Trade Deficits In the 1980s, the budget deficit and the trade deficit declined

at the same time. However, since then, the deficits have stopped being twins. The trade deficit grew smaller in the

early 1990s as the budget deficit increased, and then the trade deficit grew larger in the late 1990s as the budget

444 18 • The Impacts of Government Borrowing

deficit turned into a surplus. In the first half of the 2000s, both budget and trade deficits increased. However, in

2009, the trade deficit declined as the budget deficit increased. Through the 2010s, the trade deficit remained

relatively stable as the budget deficit declined. While the budget deficit increased in 2020, there has been hardly

any change in the trade deficit.

Of course, no one should expect the budget deficit and trade deficit to move in lockstep, because the other

parts of the national saving and investment identity—investment and private savings—will often change as

well. In the late 1990s, for example, the government budget balance turned from deficit to surplus, but the

trade deficit remained large and growing. During this time, the inflow of foreign financial investment was

supporting a surge of physical capital investment by U.S. firms. In the first half of the 2000s, the budget and

trade deficits again increased together, but in 2009, the budget deficit increased while the trade deficit

declined. Through the 2010s, as there were bigger changes in the budget deficit, the trade deficit remained

stable. The budget deficit and the trade deficits are related to each other, but they are more like cousins than

twins.

Budget Deficits and Exchange Rates

Exchange rates can also help to explain why budget deficits are linked to trade deficits. Figure 18.5 shows a
situation using the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar, measured in euros. At the original equilibrium (E0), where
the demand for U.S. dollars (D0) intersects with the supply of U.S. dollars (S0) on the foreign exchange market,
the exchange rate is 0.9 euros per U.S. dollar and the equilibrium quantity traded in the market is $100 billion

per day. Then the U.S. budget deficit rises and foreign financial investment provides the source of funds for

that budget deficit.

International financial investors, as a group, will demand more U.S. dollars on foreign exchange markets to

purchase the U.S. government bonds, and they will supply fewer of the U.S. dollars that they already hold in
these markets. Demand for U.S. dollars on the foreign exchange market shifts from D0 to D1 and the supply of
U.S. dollars falls from S0 to S1. At the new equilibrium (E1), the exchange rate has appreciated to 1.05 euros per
dollar while, in this example, the quantity of dollars traded remains the same.

FIGURE 18.5 Budget Deficits and Exchange Rates Imagine that the U.S. government increases its borrowing and

the funds come from European financial investors. To purchase U.S. government bonds, those European investors

will need to demand more U.S. dollars on foreign exchange markets, causing the demand for U.S. dollars to shift to
the right from D0 to D1. European financial investors as a group will also be less likely to supply U.S. dollars to the
foreign exchange markets, causing the supply of U.S. dollars to shift from S0 to S1. The equilibrium exchange rate
strengthens from 0.9 euro/ dollar at E0 to 1.05 euros/dollar at E1.

A stronger exchange rate, of course, makes it more difficult for exporters to sell their goods abroad while

making imports cheaper, so a trade deficit (or a reduced trade surplus) results. Thus, a budget deficit can easily

result in an inflow of foreign financial capital, a stronger exchange rate, and a trade deficit.

18.2 • Fiscal Policy and the Trade Balance 445

You can also imagine interest rates are driving the exchange rate appreciation. As we explained earlier in

Figure 18.8, a budget deficit increases demand in markets for domestic financial capital, raising the domestic

interest rate. A higher interest rate will attract an inflow of foreign financial capital, and appreciate the

exchange rate in response to the increase in demand for U.S. dollars by foreign investors and a decrease in

supply of U. S. dollars. Because of higher interest rates in the United States, Americans find U.S. bonds more

attractive than foreign bonds. When Americans are buying fewer foreign bonds, they are supplying fewer U.S.

dollars. U.S. dollar appreciation leads to a larger trade deficit (or reduced surplus). The connections between

inflows of foreign investment capital, interest rates, and exchange rates are all just different ways of drawing

the same economic connections: a larger budget deficit can result in a larger trade deficit, although do not

expect the connection to be one-to-one.

From Budget Deficits to International Economic Crisis

We lay out step-by-step the economic story of how an outflow of international financial capital can cause a

deep recession in the Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows chapter. When international financial

investors decide to withdraw their funds from a country like Turkey, they increase the supply of the Turkish

lira and reduce the demand for lira, depreciating the lira exchange rate. When firms and the government in a
country like Turkey borrow money in international financial markets, they typically do so in stages. First,
banks in Turkey borrow in a widely used currency like U.S. dollars or euros, then convert those U.S. dollars to

lira, and then lend the money to borrowers in Turkey. If the lira's exchange rate value depreciates, then

Turkey’s banks will find it impossible to repay the international loans that are in U.S. dollars or euros.

The combination of less foreign investment capital and banks that are bankrupt can sharply reduce aggregate

demand, which causes a deep recession. Many countries around the world have experienced this kind of

recession: along with Turkey in 2002, Mexico followed this general pattern in 1995, Thailand and countries

across East Asia in 1997–1998, Russia in 1998, and Argentina in 2002. In many of these countries, large

government budget deficits played a role in setting the stage for the financial crisis. A moderate increase in a

budget deficit that leads to a moderate increase in a trade deficit and a moderate appreciation of the exchange

rate is not necessarily a cause for concern. However, beyond some point that is hard to define in advance, a

series of large budget deficits can become a cause for concern among international investors.

One reason for concern is that extremely large budget deficits mean that aggregate demand may shift so far to

the right as to cause high inflation. The example of Turkey is a situation where very large budget deficits

brought inflation rates well into double digits. In addition, very large budget deficits at some point begin to

raise a fear that the government would not repay the borrowing. In the last 100 years, the government of

Turkey has been unable to pay its debts and defaulted on its loans four times. Over the past 175 years, Brazil’s

government has been unable to pay its debts and defaulted on its loans seven times; Venezuela, nine times;

and Argentina, five times. The risk of high inflation or a default on repaying international loans will worry

international investors, since both factors imply that the rate of return on their investments in that country

may end up lower than expected. If international investors start withdrawing the funds from a country rapidly,

the scenario of less investment, a depreciated exchange rate, widespread bank failure, and deep recession can

occur. The following Clear It Up feature explains other impacts of large deficits.

CLEAR IT UP

What are the risks of chronic large deficits in the United States?
If a government runs large budget deficits for a sustained period of time, what can go wrong? According to a recent

Brookings Institution report, a key risk of a large budget deficit is that government debt may grow too high

compared to the country’s GDP growth. As debt grows, the national savings rate will decline, leaving less available in

financial capital for private investment. The impact of chronically large budget deficits is as follows:

• As the population ages, there will be an increasing demand for government services that may cause higher

446 18 • The Impacts of Government Borrowing

government deficits. Government borrowing and its interest payments will pull resources away from domestic

investment in human capital and physical capital that is essential to economic growth.

•

Interest rates may start to rise so that the cost of financing government debt will rise as well, creating pressure

on the government to reduce its budget deficits through spending cuts and tax increases. These steps will be

politically painful, and they will also have a contractionary effect on aggregate demand in the economy.

• Rising percentage of debt to GDP will create uncertainty in the financial and global markets that might cause a

country to resort to inflationary tactics to reduce the real value of the debt outstanding. This will decrease real

wealth and damage confidence in the country’s ability to manage its spending. After all, if the government has

borrowed at a fixed interest rate of, say, 5%, and it lets inflation rise above that 5%, then it will effectively be

able to repay its debt at a negative real interest rate.

The conventional reasoning suggests that the relationship between sustained deficits that lead to high levels of

government debt and long-term growth is negative. How significant this relationship is, how big an issue it is

compared to other macroeconomic issues, and the direction of causality, is less clear.

What remains important to acknowledge is that the relationship between debt and growth is negative and that for

some countries, the relationship may be stronger than in others. It is also important to acknowledge the direction of
causality: does high debt cause slow growth, slow growth cause high debt, or are both high debt and slow growth
the result of third factors? In our analysis, we have argued simply that high debt causes slow growth. There may be

more to this debate than we have space to discuss here.

Using Fiscal Policy to Address Trade Imbalances

If a nation is experiencing the inflow of foreign investment capital associated with a trade deficit because

foreign investors are making long-term direct investments in firms, there may be no substantial reason for

concern. After all, many low-income nations around the world would welcome direct investment by

multinational firms that ties them more closely into the global networks of production and distribution of

goods and services. In this case, the inflows of foreign investment capital and the trade deficit are attracted by

the opportunities for a good rate of return on private sector investment in an economy.

However, governments should beware of a sustained pattern of high budget deficits and high trade deficits. The

danger arises in particular when the inflow of foreign investment capital is not funding long-term physical

capital investment by firms, but instead is short-term portfolio investment in government bonds. When

inflows of foreign financial investment reach high levels, foreign financial investors will be on the alert for any

reason to fear that the country’s exchange rate may decline or the government may be unable to repay what it

has borrowed on time. Just as a few falling rocks can trigger an avalanche; a relatively small piece of bad news

about an economy can trigger an enormous outflow of short-term financial capital.

Reducing a nation’s budget deficit will not always be a successful method of reducing its trade deficit, because

other elements of the national saving and investment identity, like private saving or investment, may change

instead. In those cases when the budget deficit is the main cause of the trade deficit, governments should take

steps to reduce their budget deficits, lest they make their economy vulnerable to a rapid outflow of

international financial capital that could bring a deep recession.

18.3 How Government Borrowing Affects Private Saving

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Apply Ricardian equivalence to evaluate how government borrowing affects private saving

•

Interpret a graphic representation of Ricardian equivalence

A change in government budgets may impact private saving. Imagine that people watch government budgets

and adjust their savings accordingly. For example, whenever the government runs a budget deficit, people

Access for free at openstax.org

18.3 • How Government Borrowing Affects Private Saving 447

might reason: “Well, a higher budget deficit means that I’m just going to owe more taxes in the future to pay off

all that government borrowing, so I’ll start saving now.” If the government runs budget surpluses, people might

reason: “With these budget surpluses (or lower budget deficits), interest rates are falling, so that saving is less

attractive. Moreover, with a budget surplus the country will be able to afford a tax cut sometime in the future. I

won’t bother saving as much now.”

The theory that rational private households might shift their saving to offset government saving or borrowing

is known as Ricardian equivalence because the idea has intellectual roots in the writings of the early

nineteenth-century economist David Ricardo (1772–1823). If Ricardian equivalence holds completely true,

then in the national saving and investment identity, any change in budget deficits or budget surpluses would

be completely offset by a corresponding change in private saving. As a result, changes in government

borrowing would have no effect at all on either physical capital investment or trade balances.

In practice, the private sector only sometimes and partially adjusts its savings behavior to offset government

budget deficits and surpluses. Figure 18.6 shows the patterns of U.S. government budget deficits and surpluses

and the rate of private saving—which includes saving by both households and firms—since 1980. The

connection between the two is not at all obvious. In the mid-1980s, for example, government budget deficits
were quite large, but there is no corresponding surge of private saving. However, when budget deficits turn to
surpluses in the late 1990s, there is a simultaneous decline in private saving. When budget deficits got very

large in 2008 and 2009, there was another a rise in saving. When the deficit increased again in 2020, saving

jumped up as well. A variety of statistical studies based on the U.S. experience suggests that when government

borrowing increases by $1, private saving rises by about 30 cents. A World Bank study from the late 1990s,

looking at government budgets and private saving behavior in countries around the world, found a similar

result.

FIGURE 18.6 U.S. Budget Deficits and Private Savings The theory of Ricardian equivalence suggests that additional

private saving will offset any increase in government borrowing, while reduced private saving will offset any

decrease in government borrowing. Sometimes this theory holds true, and sometimes it does not. (Source: Bureau

of Economic Analysis and Federal Reserve Economic Data)

Private saving does increase to some extent when governments run large budget deficits, and private saving

falls when governments reduce deficits or run large budget surpluses. However, the offsetting effects of private

saving compared to government borrowing are much less than one-to-one. In addition, this effect can vary a

great deal from country to country, from time to time, and over the short and the long run.

If the funding for a larger budget deficit comes from international financial investors, then a trade deficit may

accompany a budget deficit. In some countries, this pattern of twin deficits has set the stage for international

financial investors first to send their funds to a country and cause an appreciation of its exchange rate and

448 18 • The Impacts of Government Borrowing

then to pull their funds out and cause a depreciation of the exchange rate and a financial crisis as well. It

depends on whether funding comes from international financial investors.

18.4 Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic Growth

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain crowding out and its effect on physical capital investment

• Explain the relationship between budget deficits and interest rates

•

Identify why economic growth is tied to investments in physical capital, human capital, and technology

The underpinnings of economic growth are investments in physical capital, human capital, and technology, all

set in an economic environment where firms and individuals can react to the incentives provided by well-

functioning markets and flexible prices. Government borrowing can reduce the financial capital available for

private firms to invest in physical capital. However, government spending can also encourage certain elements

of long-term growth, such as spending on roads or water systems, on education, or on research and

development that creates new technology.

Crowding Out Physical Capital Investment

A larger budget deficit will increase demand for financial capital. If private saving and the trade balance

remain the same, then less financial capital will be available for private investment in physical capital. When

government borrowing soaks up available financial capital and leaves less for private investment in physical

capital, economists call the result crowding out.

To understand the potential impact of crowding out, consider the U.S. economy's situation before the

exceptional circumstances of the recession that started in late 2007. In 2005, for example, the budget deficit

was roughly 3% of GDP. Private investment by firms in the U.S. economy has hovered in the range of 14% to

18% of GDP in recent decades. However, in any given year, roughly half of U.S. investment in physical capital

just replaces machinery and equipment that has worn out or become technologically obsolete. Only about half

represents an increase in the total quantity of physical capital in the economy. Investment in new physical

capital in any year is about 7% to 9% of GDP. In this situation, even U.S. budget deficits in the range of 3% of

GDP can potentially crowd out a substantial share of new investment spending. Conversely, a smaller budget

deficit (or an increased budget surplus) increases the pool of financial capital available for private investment.

Figure 18.7 shows the patterns of U.S. budget deficits and private investment since 1980. If greater

government deficits lead to less private investment in physical capital, and reduced government deficits or

budget surpluses lead to more investment in physical capital, these two lines should move up and down

simultaneously. This pattern occurred in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The U.S. federal budget went from a

deficit of 2.2% of GDP in 1995 to a budget surplus of 2.4% of GDP in 2000—a swing of 4.6% of GDP. From 1995

to 2000, private investment in physical capital rose from 15% to 18% of GDP—a rise of 3% of GDP. Then, when

the U.S. government again started running budget deficits in the early 2000s, less financial capital became

available for private investment, and the rate of private investment fell back to about 15% of GDP by 2003.

However, in more recent years, in the 2010s after the economy recovered from the Great Recession, private

investment as a share of GDP increased even as deficits slightly worsened, especially around 2016. And while

the deficit increased substantially in 2020, private investment as a share of GDP did not.

private investment sometimes rise and fall together. For example, the 1990s show a pattern in which reduced

government borrowing helped to reduce crowding out so that more funds were available for private investment.

This argument does not claim that a government's budget deficits will exactly shadow its national rate of

private investment; after all, we must account for private saving and inflows of foreign financial investment. In

the mid-1980s, for example, government budget deficits increased substantially without a corresponding drop

off in private investment. In 2009, nonresidential private fixed investment dropped by $300 billion from its

previous level of $1,941 billion in 2008, primarily because, during a recession, firms lack both the funds and

the incentive to invest. Investment growth between 2009 and 2014 averaged approximately 5.9% to $2,210.5

billion—only slightly above its 2008 level, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. During that same

period, interest rates dropped from 3.94% to less than a quarter percent as the Federal Reserve took dramatic

action to prevent a depression by increasing the money supply through lowering short-term interest rates. The

"crowding out" of private investment due to government borrowing to finance expenditures appears to have

been suspended after the Great Recession.

The Interest Rate Connection

Assume that government borrowing of substantial amounts will have an effect on the quantity of private
investment. How will this affect interest rates in financial markets? In Figure 18.8, the original equilibrium (E0)
where the demand curve (D0) for financial capital intersects with the supply curve (S0) occurs at an interest
rate of 5% and an equilibrium quantity equal to 20% of GDP. However, as the government budget deficit
increases, the demand curve for financial capital shifts from D0 to D1. The new equilibrium (E1) occurs at an
interest rate of 6% and an equilibrium quantity of 21% of GDP.

FIGURE 18.8 Budget Deficits and Interest Rates In the financial market, an increase in government borrowing can

450 18 • The Impacts of Government Borrowing

shift the demand curve for financial capital to the right from D0 to D1. As the equilibrium interest rate shifts from E0
to E1, the interest rate rises from 5% to 6% in this example. The higher interest rate is one economic mechanism by
which government borrowing can crowd out private investment.

A survey of economic studies on the connection between government borrowing and interest rates in the U.S.

economy suggests that an increase of 1% in the budget deficit will lead to a rise in interest rates of between 0.5

and 1.0%, other factors held equal. In turn, a higher interest rate tends to discourage firms from making

physical capital investments. One reason government budget deficits crowd out private investment, therefore,

is the increase in interest rates. There are, however, economic studies that show a limited connection between

the two (at least in the United States), but as the budget deficit grows, the dangers of rising interest rates

become more real.

At this point, you may wonder about the Federal Reserve. After all, can the Federal Reserve not use

expansionary monetary policy to reduce interest rates, or in this case, to prevent interest rates from rising?

This useful question emphasizes the importance of considering how fiscal and monetary policies work in

relation to each other. Imagine a central bank faced with a government that is running large budget deficits,

causing a rise in interest rates and crowding out private investment. If the budget deficits are increasing
aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near potential GDP, threatening an inflationary
increase in price levels, the central bank may react with a contractionary monetary policy. In this situation, the

higher interest rates from the government borrowing would be made even higher by contractionary monetary

policy, and the government borrowing might crowd out a great deal of private investment.

Alternatively, if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing

substantially less than potential GDP, an inflationary increase in the price level is not much of a danger and the

central bank might react with expansionary monetary policy. In this situation, higher interest rates from

government borrowing would be largely offset by lower interest rates from expansionary monetary policy, and

there would be little crowding out of private investment.

However, even a central bank cannot erase the overall message of the national savings and investment identity.

If government borrowing rises, then private investment must fall, or private saving must rise, or the trade

deficit must rise. By reacting with contractionary or expansionary monetary policy, the central bank can only

help to determine which of these outcomes is likely.

Public Investment in Physical Capital

Government can invest in physical capital directly: roads and bridges; water supply and sewers; seaports and

airports; schools and hospitals; plants that generate electricity, like hydroelectric dams or windmills;

telecommunications facilities; and military weapons. In 2021, the United States spent about $146 billion on

transportation, including highways, mass transit, and airports. Table 18.1 shows the federal government's

total outlay for 2021 for major public physical capital investment in the United States. We have omitted

physical capital related to the military or to residences where people live from this table, because the focus

here is on public investments that have a direct effect on raising output in the private sector.

Public physical capital investment of this sort can increase the economy's output and productivity. An

economy with reliable roads and electricity will be able to produce more. However, it is hard to quantify how

much government investment in physical capital will benefit the economy, because government responds to

political as well as economic incentives. When a firm makes an investment in physical capital, it is subject to

the discipline of the market: If it does not receive a positive return on investment, the firm may lose money or

even go out of business.

In some cases, lawmakers make investments in physical capital as a way of spending money in key politicians'

districts. The result may be unnecessary roads or office buildings. Even if a project is useful and necessary, it

might be done in a way that is excessively costly, because local contractors who make campaign contributions

to politicians appreciate the extra business. Alternatively, governments sometimes do not make the

investments they should because a decision to spend on infrastructure does not need to just make economic

sense. It must be politically popular as well. Managing public investment cost-effectively can be difficult.

If a government decides to finance an investment in public physical capital with higher taxes or lower

government spending in other areas, it need not worry that it is directly crowding out private investment.

Indirectly however, higher household taxes could cut down on the level of private savings available and have a

similar effect. If a government decides to finance an investment in public physical capital by borrowing, it may

end up increasing the quantity of public physical capital at the cost of crowding out investment in private

physical capital, which could be more beneficial to the economy.

Public Investment in Human Capital

In most countries, the government plays a large role in society's investment in human capital through the

education system. A highly educated and skilled workforce contributes to a higher rate of economic growth.

For the low-income nations of the world, additional investment in human capital seems likely to increase

productivity and growth. For the United States, critics have raised tough questions about how much increases
in government spending on education will improve the actual level of education.

Among economists, discussions of education reform often begin with some uncomfortable facts. As Figure

18.9 shows, spending per student for kindergarten through grade 12 (K–12) increased substantially in real

dollars through 2010, declined slightly in 2011 and 2012, and began rising again after that through 2020.

However, as measured by standardized tests like the SAT, the level of student academic achievement has

barely budged in recent decades. On international tests, U.S. students lag behind students from many other

countries. (Of course, test scores are an imperfect measure of education for a variety of reasons. It would be

difficult, however, to argue that there are not real problems in the U.S. education system and that the tests are

just inaccurate.)

452 18 • The Impacts of Government Borrowing

FIGURE 18.9 Total Spending for Elementary, Secondary, and Vocational Education (1998–2020) in the United

States The graph shows that government spending on education was continually increasing up until 2006 where it

leveled off until 2008 when it increased dramatically. Since 2010, spending has steadily decreased. (Source: Office

of Management and Budget)

The fact that increased financial resources have not brought greater measurable gains in student performance

has led some education experts to question whether the problems may be due to structure, not just to the

resources spent.

Other government programs seek to increase human capital either before or after the K–12 education system.

Programs for early childhood education, like the federal Head Start program, are directed at families where

the parents may have limited educational and financial resources. Government also offers substantial support

for universities and colleges. For example, in the United States about 60% of students take at least a few college

or university classes beyond the high school level. In Germany and Japan, about half of all students take

classes beyond the comparable high school level. In the countries of Latin America, only about one student in

four takes classes beyond the high school level, and in the nations of sub-Saharan Africa, only about one

student in 20.

Not all spending on educational human capital needs to happen through the government: many college

students in the United States pay a substantial share of the cost of their education. If low-income countries of

the world are going to experience a widespread increase in their education levels for grade-school children,

government spending seems likely to play a substantial role. For the U.S. economy, and for other high-income

countries, the primary focus at this time is more on how to get a bigger return from existing spending on
education and how to improve the performance of the average high school graduate, rather than dramatic

increases in education spending.

How Fiscal Policy Can Improve Technology

Research and development (R&D) efforts are the lifeblood of new technology. According to the National Science

Foundation, federal outlays for research, development, and physical plant improvements to various

governmental agencies have remained at an average of 8.8% of GDP. About one-fifth of U.S. R&D spending goes

to defense and space-oriented research. Although defense-oriented R&D spending may sometimes produce

consumer-oriented spinoffs, R&D that is aimed at producing new weapons is less likely to benefit the civilian

economy than direct civilian R&D spending.

Fiscal policy can encourage R&D using either direct spending or tax policy. Government could spend more on

the R&D that it carries out in government laboratories, as well as expanding federal R&D grants to universities

and colleges, nonprofit organizations, and the private sector. By 2014, the federal share of R&D outlays totaled

$135.5 billion, or about 4% of the federal government's total budget outlays, according to data from the

18.4 • Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic Growth 453

National Science Foundation. Fiscal policy can also support R&D through tax incentives, which allow firms to

reduce their tax bill as they increase spending on research and development.

Summary of Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic Growth

Investment in physical capital, human capital, and new technology is essential for long-term economic growth,

as Table 18.2 summarizes. In a market-oriented economy, private firms will undertake most of the investment

in physical capital, and fiscal policy should seek to avoid a long series of outsized budget deficits that might

crowd out such investment. We will see the effects of many growth-oriented policies very gradually over time,

as students are better educated, we make physical capital investments, and man invents and implements new

technologies.

Financing Higher Education
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, between 1980 and 2020, the average tuition and fees at a 4-year public

university increased from $738 to $9,349. This represents a more than 12-fold increase in this 40 year period. To

put this increase into perspective, median yearly household income in the U.S. has increased from about $20,000 to

$67,000 during the same time—about a 3.5-fold increase. Clearly, college is becoming increasingly expensive, even

as it continues to provide the same benefits that were mentioned at the beginning of this chapter by President

Lyndon B. Johnson.

Crucial to the mission of higher education is the Pell Grant program, which was initiated by President Johnson as

part of the Higher Education Act of 1965. But Pell Grant amounts have not adequately kept up with the rising costs

of college tuition and fees. As part of President Joe Biden's Build Back Better proposal, the maximum Pell Grant

award would increase to $7,045 between 2022–2025, representing an 8.5% increase, which is one of the largest

1-year increases in the last 20 years (the largest increase occurred between 2009 and 2010, during President

Barack Obama's term in office). The original proposal also aimed to allow for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals

program participants to benefit from the awards, through 2030.

Key Concepts and Summary

18.1 How Government Borrowing Affects Investment and the Trade Balance

A change in any part of the national saving and investment identity suggests that if the government budget

deficit changes, then either private savings, private investment in physical capital, or the trade balance—or

some combination of the three—must change as well.

18.2 Fiscal Policy and the Trade Balance

The government need not balance its budget every year. However, a sustained pattern of large budget deficits

over time risks causing several negative macroeconomic outcomes: a shift to the right in aggregate demand

that causes an inflationary increase in the price level; crowding out private investment in physical capital in a

way that slows down economic growth; and creating a dependence on inflows of international portfolio

investment which can sometimes turn into outflows of foreign financial investment that can be injurious to a

macroeconomy.

18.3 How Government Borrowing Affects Private Saving

The theory of Ricardian equivalence holds that changes in private saving will offset changes in government

borrowing or saving. Thus, greater private saving will offset higher budget deficits, while greater private

borrowing will offset larger budget surpluses. If the theory holds true, then changes in government borrowing

or saving would have no effect on private investment in physical capital or on the trade balance. However,

empirical evidence suggests that the theory holds true only partially.

18.4 Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic Growth

Economic growth comes from a combination of investment in physical capital, human capital, and technology.

Government borrowing can crowd out private sector investment in physical capital, but fiscal policy can also

increase investment in publicly owned physical capital, human capital (education), and research and

development. Possible methods for improving education and society’s investment in human capital include

spending more money on teachers and other educational resources, and reorganizing the education system to

provide greater incentives for success. Methods for increasing research and development spending to generate
new technology include direct government spending on R&D and tax incentives for businesses to conduct

additional R&D.

26. Sketch a diagram of how sustained budget deficits cause low economic growth.

27. Assume that the newly independent government of Tanzania employed you in 1964. Now free from British

rule, the Tanzanian parliament has decided that it will spend 10 million shillings on schools, roads, and

healthcare for the year. You estimate that the net taxes for the year are eight million shillings. The

government will finance the difference by selling 10-year government bonds at 12% interest per year.

Parliament must add the interest on outstanding bonds to government expenditure each year. Assume

that Parliament places additional taxes to finance this increase in government expenditure so the gap

between government spending is always two million. If the school, road, and healthcare budget are

unchanged, compute the value of the accumulated debt in 10 years.

28. Illustrate the concept of Ricardian equivalence using the demand and supply of financial capital graph.

29. During the most recent recession, some economists argued that the change in the interest rates that

comes about due to deficit spending implied in the demand and supply of financial capital graph would

not occur. A simple reason was that the government was stepping in to invest when private firms were not.

Youth Unemployment
Chad Harding, a young man from Cape Town, South Africa, completed school having done well on his exams. He had

458 19 • Macroeconomic Policy Around the World

high hopes for the future. Like many young South Africans, however, he had difficulty finding a job. “I was just stuck

at home waiting, waiting for something to come up,” he said in a BBC interview. In South Africa over 60% of young

adults are unemployed. In fact, the problem is not limited to South Africa. Seventy-three million of the world’s youth

aged 15 to 24 are currently unemployed, according to the International Labour Organization.

This chapter will look at macroeconomic policies around the world, specifically those related to reducing

unemployment, promoting economic growth, and stable inflation and exchange rates.

There are extraordinary differences in the composition and performance of economies across the world. What

explains these differences? Are countries motivated by similar goals when it comes to macroeconomic policy?

Can we apply the same macroeconomic framework that we developed in this text to understand the

performance of these countries? Let’s take each of these questions in turn.

Explaining differences: Recall from Unemployment that we explained the difference in composition and

performance of economies by appealing to an aggregate production function. We argued that differences in

productivity explain the diversity of average incomes across the world, which in turn were affected by inputs

such as capital deepening, human capital, and “technology.” Every economy has its own distinctive economic

characteristics, institutions, history, and political realities, which imply that access to these “ingredients” will

vary by country and so will economic performance.

For example, South Korea invested heavily in education and technology to increase agricultural productivity in

the early 1950s. Some of this investment came from its historical relationship with the United States. As a

result of these and many other institutions, its economy has managed to converge to the levels of income in

leading economies like Japan and the United States.

Similar goals and frameworks: Many economies that have performed well in terms of per capita income

have—for better or worse—been motivated by a similar goal: to maintain the quality of life of their citizens.

Quality of life is a broad term, but as you can imagine it includes but is not limited to such things as low level of

unemployment, price stability (low levels of inflation), and the ability to trade. These seem to be universal

macroeconomic goals as we discussed in The Macroeconomic Perspective. No country would argue against

them. To study macroeconomic policy around the world, we begin by comparing standards of living. In

keeping with these goals, we also look at indicators such as unemployment, inflation, and the balance of trade

policies across countries. Remember that every country has had a diverse set of experiences; therefore

although our goals may be similar, each country may well require macroeconomic policies tailored to its

circumstances.

19.1 The Diversity of Countries and Economies across the World

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Analyze GDP and GNI per capita as a measure of the diversity of international standards of living

•

Identify what classifies a country as low income, lower-middle income, upper-middle income, or high

income

• Explain how geography, demographics, industry structure, and economic institutions influence standards

of living

The national economies that comprise the global economy are remarkably diverse. Let us use one key

indicator of the standard of living, GDP per capita, to quantify this diversity. You will quickly see that

Access for free at openstax.org

19.1 • The Diversity of Countries and Economies across the World 459

quantifying this diversity is fraught with challenges and limitations. As we explained in The Macroeconomic

Perspective, we must consider using purchasing power parity or “international dollars” to convert average

incomes into comparable units. Purchasing power parity, as we formally defined in Exchange Rates and

International Capital Flows, takes into account that prices of the same good are different across countries.

The Macroeconomic Perspective explained how to measure GDP, the challenges of using GDP to compare

standards of living, and the difficulty of confusing economic size with distribution. In China’s case, for

example, China ranks as the second largest global economy, second to only the United States, with Japan

ranking third. However, when we take China’s GDP of $9.2 trillion and divide it by its population of 1.4 billion,

then the per capita GDP is only $6,900, which is significantly lower than that of Japan, at $38,500, and that of

the United States, at $52,800. Measurement issues aside, it’s worth repeating that the goal, then, is to not only

increase GDP, but to strive toward increased GDP per capita to increase overall living standards for individuals.

As we have learned from Economic Growth, countries can achieve this at the national level by designing

policies that increase worker productivity, deepen capital, and advance technology.

The related measure gross national income (GNI) per capita also allows us to rank countries into high-, upper-

middle-, lower-middle-, or low-income groups. The World Bank updates the classifications each year. Low-
income countries are those with $1,085 per capita GNI per year; lower-middle-income countries have a per
capita GNI between $1,086 and $4,255; upper-middle-income countries have a per capita GDP between

$4,265 and $13,205; while high-income countries have over $13,206 per year per capita income. According to

the 2022 classifications, there are 27 low-income nations and 80 high-income nations. The other 110

measured nations occupy the two tiers of middle-income nations, and are comprised of the vast

majority—75%, of the world’s population. Despite the population and quantitative majority, these nations only

produce one third of global GNI and have nearly two-thirds of the world’s people living in poverty.

An overview of the regional averages of GDP per person for developing countries, measured in comparable

international dollars as well as population in 2018 (Figure 19.3), shows that the differences across these

regions are stark. As Table 19.2 shows, nominal GDP per capita in 2020 for the 652 million people living in

Latin America and the Caribbean region (excluding high income countries in that region) was $6,799, which

far exceeds that of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In turn, people in the world’s high-income nations, such

as those who live in the European Union nations or North America, have a per capita GDP three to four times

that of the people of Latin America. To put things in perspective, North America and the European Union (plus

the United Kingdom) have slightly more than 10% of the world’s population, but they produce and consume

about 44% of the world’s GDP.

Population in 2020 GDP per capita excludes high income countries in each

region. (Source: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD)

Such comparisons between regions are admittedly rough. After all, per capita GDP cannot fully capture the

quality of life. Many other factors have a large impact on the standard of living, like health, education, human

rights, crime and personal safety, and environmental quality. These measures also reveal very wide

differences in the standard of living across the regions of the world. Much of this is correlated with per capita

income, but there are exceptions. For example, life expectancy at birth in many low-income regions

approximates those who are more affluent. The data also illustrate that nobody can claim to have perfect

standards of living. For instance, despite very high income levels, there is still undernourishment in Europe

and North America.

Economists know that there are many factors that contribute to your standard of living. People in high-income

countries may have very little time due to heavy workloads and may feel disconnected from their community.

Lower-income countries may be more community centered, but have little in the way of material wealth. It is

hard to measure these characteristics of standard of living. The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and
Development has developed the “OECD Better Life Index.” Visit this website (http://openstax.org/l/

standofliving) to see how countries measure up to your expected standard of living.

The differences in economic statistics and other measures of well-being, substantial though they are, do not

fully capture the reasons for the enormous differences between countries. Aside from the neoclassical

determinants of growth, four additional determinants are significant in a wide range of statistical studies and

are worth mentioning: geography, demography, industrial structure, and institutions.

Geographic and Demographic Differences

Countries have geographic differences: some have extensive coastlines, some are landlocked. Some have large

rivers that have been a path of commerce for centuries, or mountains that have been a barrier to trade. Some

have deserts, some have rain forests. These differences create different positive and negative opportunities for

commerce, health, and the environment.

Countries also have considerable differences in the age distribution of the population. Many high-income

462 19 • Macroeconomic Policy Around the World

nations are approaching a situation by 2020 or so in which the elderly will form a much larger share of the

population. Most low-income countries still have a higher proportion of youth and young adults, but by about

2050, the elderly populations in these low-income countries are expected to boom as well. These demographic

changes will have considerable impact on the standard of living of the young and the old.

Differences in Industry Structure and Economic Institutions

Countries have differences in industry structure. In the world’s high-income economies, only about 2% of GDP

comes from agriculture; the average for the rest of the world is 12%. Countries have strong differences in

degree of urbanization.

Countries also have strong differences in economic institutions: some nations have economies that are

extremely market-oriented, while other nations have command economies. Some nations are open to

international trade, while others use tariffs and import quotas to limit the impact of trade. Some nations are

torn by long-standing armed conflicts; other nations are largely at peace. There are also differences in

political, religious, and social institutions.

No nation intentionally aims for a low standard of living, high rates of unemployment and inflation, or an

unsustainable trade imbalance. However, nations will differ in their priorities and in the situations in which
they find themselves, and so their policy choices can reasonably vary, too. The next modules will discuss how

nations around the world, from high income to low income, approach the four macroeconomic goals of

economic growth, low unemployment, low inflation, and a sustainable balance of trade.

19.2 Improving Countries’ Standards of Living

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Analyze the growth policies of low-income countries seeking to improve standards of living

• Analyze the growth policies of middle-income countries, particularly the East Asian Tigers with their focus

on technology and market-oriented incentives

• Analyze the struggles facing economically-challenged countries wishing to enact growth policies

• Evaluate the success of sending aid to low-income countries

Jobs are created in economies that grow. What is the origin of economic growth? According to most economists

who believe in the growth consensus, economic growth (as we discussed in Economic Growth) is built on a

foundation of productivity improvements. In turn, productivity increases are the result of greater human and

physical capital and technology, all interacting in a market-driven economy. In the pursuit of economic growth,

however, some countries and regions start from different levels, as the differences in per capita GDP presented

earlier in Table 19.2 illustrate.

Growth Policies for the High-Income Countries

For the high-income countries, the challenge of economic growth is to push continually for a more educated

workforce that can create, invest in, and apply new technologies. In effect, the goal of their growth-oriented

public policy is to shift their aggregate supply curves to the right (refer to The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate

Supply Model). The main public policies targeted at achieving this goal are fiscal policies focused on

investment, including investment in human capital, in technology, and in physical plant and equipment. These

countries also recognize that economic growth works best in a stable and market-oriented economic climate.

For this reason, they use monetary policy to keep inflation low and stable, and to minimize the risk of

exchange rate fluctuations, while also encouraging domestic and international competition.

However, early in the second decade of the 2000s, many high-income countries found themselves more

focused on the short term than on the long term. The United States, Western Europe, and Japan all

experienced a combination of financial crisis and deep recession, and the after-effects of the recession—like

high unemployment rates—seemed likely to linger for several years. Most of these governments took

19.2 • Improving Countries’ Standards of Living 463

aggressive, and in some cases controversial, steps to jump-start their economies by running very large budget

deficits as part of expansionary fiscal policy. These countries must adopt a course that combines lower

government spending and higher taxes.

Similarly, many central banks ran highly expansionary monetary policies, with both near-zero interest rates

and unconventional loans and investments. For example, in 2012, Shinzo Abe (see Figure 19.4), then newly-

elected Prime Minister of Japan, unveiled a plan to pull his country out of its two-decade-long slump in

economic growth. It included both fiscal stimulus and an increase in the money supply. The plan was

successful in some ways and unsuccessful in others. While real GDP growth in Japan has averaged around 1%

since 2012 (and was only 0.2% in 2014 and 0.7% in 2016) and while the inflation rate has struggled to stay

positive in recent years, the unemployment rate continued to decline through the 2010s. By early 2020, prior

to the pandemic, the unemployment rate stood at just 2.5%. Public debt has also reached a plateau in the last

5–7 years of about 230–240% of GDP, although this number did increase slightly in 2020 due to the pandemic.

Shinzo Abe stepped down as Prime Minister of Japan in 2020, and was assassinated in 2022.

economy, which has helped bring down unemployment, but inflation remains stubbornly low. (Credit: modification

As we discussed in other chapters, macroeconomics needs to have both a short-run and a long-run focus. The

challenge for many of the developed countries in the next few years will be to grapple with the consequences of

the pandemic. With high unemployment and no end of the virus containment in sight, it will be challenging for

these governments to refocus their efforts on new technology, education, and physical capital investment.

Growth Policies for the Middle-Income Economies

The world’s great economic success stories in the last few decades began in the 1970s with that group of

nations sometimes known as the East Asian Tigers: South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and

Singapore. The list sometimes includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, although often under international law they

are treated as part of China, rather than as separate countries. The economic growth of the Tigers has been

phenomenal, typically averaging 5.5% real per capita growth for several decades. In the 1980s, other countries

began to show signs of convergence. China began growing rapidly, often at annual rates of 8% to 10% per year.

India began growing rapidly, first at rates of about 5% per year in the 1990s, but then higher still in the first

decade of the 2000s.

We know the underlying causes of these rapid growth rates:

• China and the East Asian Tigers, in particular, have been among the highest savers in the world, often

saving one-third or more of GDP as compared to the roughly one-fifth of GDP, which would be a more

typical saving rate in Latin America and Africa. These countries harnessed higher savings for domestic

investment to build physical capital.

• These countries had policies that supported heavy investments in human capital, first building up

primary-level education and then expanding secondary-level education. Many focused on encouraging

math and science education, which is useful in engineering and business.

• Governments made a concerted effort to seek out applicable technology, by sending students and

464 19 • Macroeconomic Policy Around the World

government commissions abroad to look at the most efficient industrial operations elsewhere. They also

created policies to support innovative companies that wished to build production facilities to take

advantage of the abundant and inexpensive human capital.

• China and India in particular also allowed far greater freedom for market forces, both within their own

domestic economies and also in encouraging their firms to participate in world markets.

This combination of technology, human capital, and physical capital, combined with the incentives of a

market-oriented economic context, proved an extremely powerful stimulant to growth. Challenges that these

middle-income countries faced are a legacy of government economic controls that for political reasons can be

dismantled only slowly over time. In many of them, the government heavily regulates the banking and

financial sector. Governments have also sometimes selected certain industries to receive low-interest loans or

government subsidies. These economies have found that an increased dose of market-oriented incentives for

firms and workers has been a critical ingredient in the recipe for faster growth. To learn more about

measuring economic growth, read the following Clear It Up feature.

CLEAR IT UP

What is the rule of 72?
It is worth pausing a moment to marvel at the East Asian Tigers' growth rates. If per capita GDP grows at, say, 6%
per year, then you can apply the formula for compound growth rates—that is (1 + 0.06)30—meaning a nation’s level
of per capita GDP will rise by a multiple of almost six over 30 years. Another strategy is to apply the rule of 72. The

rule of 72 is an approximation to figure out doubling time. We divide the rule number, 72, by the annual growth rate

to obtain the approximate number of years it will take for income to double. If we have a 6% growth rate, it will take

72/6, or 12 years, for incomes to double. Using this rule here suggests that a Tiger that grows at 6% will double its

GDP every 12 years. In contrast, a technological leader, chugging along with per capita growth rates of about 2% per

year, would double its income in 36 years.

Growth Policies for Economically-Challenged Countries

Many economically-challenged or low-income countries are geographically located in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Other pockets of low income are in the former Soviet Bloc, and in parts of Central America and the Caribbean.

There are macroeconomic policies and prescriptions that might alleviate the extreme poverty and low

standard of living. However, many of these countries lack the economic and legal stability, along with market-

oriented institutions, needed to provide a fertile climate for domestic economic growth and to attract foreign

investment. Thus, macroeconomic policies for low income economies are vastly different from those of the

high income economies. The World Bank has made it a priority to combat poverty and raise overall income

levels through 2030. One of the key obstacles to achieving this is the political instability that seems to be a

common feature of low-income countries.

Figure 19.5 shows the ten lowest income countries as ranked by The World Bank in 2020. These countries

share some common traits, the most significant of which is the recent failures of their governments to provide

a legal framework for economic growth. Civil and ethnic wars have impacted Burundi. Command economies,

corruption, as well as political factionalism and infighting are commonly adopted elements in these low-

income countries. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (often referred to as “Congo”) is a resource-wealthy

country that has not been able to increase its subsistence standard of living due to the political environment.

FIGURE 19.5 The Ten Lowest Income Countries This bar chart that shows the ten lowest-income countries by per

African Republic, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Niger, and Sudan. (Source:

http://databank.worldbank.org/data/views/reports/map.aspx#)

Low-income countries are at a disadvantage because any incomes that people receive are spent immediately

on necessities such as food. People in these countries live on less than $1,035 per year, which is less than $100

per month. Lack of saving means a lack of capital accumulation and a lack of loanable funds for investment in

physical and human capital. Recent research by two MIT economists, Abhijit Bannerjee and Esther Duflo, has

confirmed that the households in these economies are trapped in low incomes because they cannot muster

enough investment to push themselves out of poverty.

For example, the average citizen of Burundi, a low-income country, subsists on $239 per year (adjusted to

2020 dollars). According to Central Intelligence Agency data in its CIA Factbook, as of 2021, 85% of Burundi’s

population is agrarian, with bananas as the main income producing crop. Only one in two children attends

school and, as Figure 19.6 shows, many are not in schools comparable to what occurs in developed countries.

Political instability has made it difficult for Burundi to make significant headway toward growth, as verified by

the electrification of only 11% of households and 40% of its national income coming from foreign aid.

FIGURE 19.6 Lack of Funds for Investing in Human Capital In low-income countries, people often spend all income

The World Factbook website (http://openstax.org/l/worldfactbook) is loaded with maps, flags, and other

information about countries across the globe.

Other low-income countries share similar stories. These countries have found it difficult to generate

investments for themselves or to find foreign investors willing to put up the money for more than the basic

needs. Foreign aid and external investment comprise significant portions of the income in these economies,

but are not sufficient to allow for the capital accumulation necessary to invest in physical and human capital.

However, is foreign aid always a contributor to economic growth?

Development economics is a branch of economics that often focuses on answering that question and others

like it. Development economists analyze the forces and outcomes of economics in developing nations. The field

is typically focused on—and sometimes defined as—understanding and implementing policies and practices to

improve economic and social wellbeing in low- and middle-income nations or regions. But it is an extremely

wide and varied area of study, often blending politics, fiscal policy, education, innovation, health and medicine,

international trade, natural resources, and military/geopolitical considerations.

Many development economists have focused on understanding the best mix of approaches to foster equitable

and sustainable growth. Like other economists, they may analyze practices or outcomes from the past and

apply that knowledge to the present and future. And many prominent development economists challenge

traditional ways of thinking. Dambisa Moyo, for example, provides evidence indicating that foreign aid is rarely

a positive solution and often does more harm than good. In her book Dead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and

How There Is Another Way for Africa(2009), she lays out the failure of past aid, indicating that it typically ends

up in the pockets of corrupt officials and has the adverse effect of minimizing other types of investment. At the

time, Moyo proposed a complete stoppage of foreign aid into Africa. Moyo sees far greater promise in increases

in trade and direct private investment, as well as other financing options such as bonds.

CLEAR IT UP

Does foreign aid to low-income countries work?
According to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), about $134 billion per year in

foreign aid flows from the high-income countries of the world to the low-income ones. Relative to the size of their

populations or economies, this is not a large amount for either donors or recipients. For low-income countries, aid

averages about 1.3 percent of their GDP. However, even this relatively small amount has been highly controversial.

Supporters of additional foreign aid point to the extraordinary human suffering in the world's low-and middle-
income countries. They see opportunities all across Africa, Asia, and Latin America to set up health clinics and

schools. They want to help with the task of building economic infrastructure: clean water, plumbing, electricity, and

roads. Supporters of this aid include formal state-sponsored institutions like the United Kingdom’s Department for

International Development (DFID) or independent non-governmental organizations (NGOs) like CARE International

that also receive donor government funds. For example, because of an outbreak of meningitis in Ethiopia in 2010,

DFID channeled significant funds to the Ethiopian Ministry of Health to train rural health care workers and also for

vaccines. These monies helped the Ministry offset shortfalls in their budget.

Opponents of increased aid do not quarrel with the goal of reducing human suffering, but they suggest that foreign

aid has often proved a poor tool for advancing that goal. For example, according to an article in the Attaché Journal

of International Affairs, the Canadian foreign aid organization (CIDA) provided $100 million to Tanzania to grow

wheat. The project did produce wheat, but nomadic pastoralists and other villagers who had lived on the land were

driven off 100,000 acres of land to make way for the project. The damage in terms of human rights and lost

livelihoods was significant. Villagers were beaten and killed because some refused to leave the land. At times, the

19.3 • Causes of Unemployment around the World 467

unintended collateral damage from foreign aid can be significant.

William Easterly, professor of economics at New York University, argues that countries often receive aid for political

reasons and the aid does more harm than good. If a country's government creates a reasonably stable and market-

oriented macroeconomic climate, then foreign investors will be likely to provide funds for many profitable activities.

For example, Facebook partnered with multiple organizations in a project called Internet.org to provide access in

remote and low-income areas of the world, and Google began its own initiative called Project Loon in 2011, although

it was phased out in 2021. Facebook’s first forays into providing internet access via mobile phones began in stable,

market-oriented countries like India, Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, and the Philippines and continues its work in Africa

by working with telecommunications corporations in China to develop an undersea cable network.

Policymakers are now wiser about foreign aid limitations than they were a few decades ago. In targeted and specific

cases, especially if foreign aid is channeled to long-term investment projects, foreign aid can have a modest role to

play in reducing the extreme levels of deprivation that hundreds of millions of people around the world experience.

19.3 Causes of Unemployment around the World

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain the nature and causes of unemployment

• Analyze the natural rate of unemployment and the factors that affect it

•

Identify how undeveloped labor markets can result in the same hardships as unemployment

We can categorize the causes of unemployment in the world's high-income countries in two ways: either

cyclical unemployment caused by the economy when in a recession, or the natural rate of unemployment

caused by factors in labor markets, such as government regulations regarding hiring and starting businesses.

Unemployment from a Recession

For unemployment caused by a recession, the Keynesian economic model points out that both monetary and

fiscal policy tools are available. The monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward:

run an expansionary monetary policy to increase the quantity of money and loans, drive down interest rates,

and increase aggregate demand. In a recession, there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off,

and so even a central bank, with fighting inflation as its top priority, can usually justify some reduction in
interest rates.

With regard to fiscal policy, the automatic stabilizers that we discussed in Government Budgets and Fiscal

Policy should be allowed to work, even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession. There is less

agreement over whether, in addition to automatic stabilizers, governments in a recession should try to adopt

discretionary fiscal policy of additional tax cuts or spending increases. In the case of the Great Recession, the

case for this kind of extra-aggressive expansionary fiscal policy is stronger, but for a smaller recession, given

the time lags of implementing fiscal policy, countries should use discretionary fiscal policy with caution.

However, the aftermath of the Recession emphasizes that expansionary fiscal and monetary policies do not

turn off a recession like flipping a switch turns off a lamp. Even after a recession is officially over, and positive

growth has returned, it can take some months—or even a couple of years—before private-sector firms believe

the economic climate is healthy enough that they can expand their workforce.

468 19 • Macroeconomic Policy Around the World

The Natural Rate of Unemployment

Unemployment rates in European nations have typically been higher than in the United States. In 2020, before

the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. unemployment rate was 3.5%, compared with 8.5% in France,

10% in Italy, and 7.1% in Sweden. We can attribute the pattern of generally higher unemployment rates in

Europe, which dates back to the 1970s, to the fact that European economies have a higher natural rate of

unemployment because they have a greater number of rules and restrictions that discourage firms from hiring

and unemployed workers from taking jobs.

Addressing the natural rate of unemployment is straightforward in theory but difficult in practice. Government

can play a useful role in providing unemployment and welfare payments, for example, by passing rules about

where and when businesses can operate, and assuring that the workplace is safe. However, these well-

intentioned laws can, in some cases, become so intrusive that businesses decide to place limits on their hiring.

For example, a law that imposes large costs on a business that tries to fire or lay off workers will mean that

businesses try to avoid hiring in the first place, as is the case in France. According to Business Week, “France

has 2.4 times as many companies with 49 employees as with 50 ... according to the French labor code, once a

company has at least 50 employees inside France, management must create three worker councils, introduce

profit sharing, and submit restructuring plans to the councils if the company decides to fire workers for

economic reasons.” This labor law essentially limits employment (or raises the natural rate of unemployment).

Undeveloped and Transitioning Labor Markets

Low-income and middle-income countries face employment issues that go beyond unemployment as it is

understood in the high-income economies. A substantial number of workers in these economies provide many

of their own needs by farming, fishing, or hunting. They barter and trade with others and may take a

succession of short-term or one-day jobs, sometimes receiving pay with food or shelter, sometimes with

money. They are not “unemployed” in the sense that we use the term in the United States and Europe, but

neither are they employed in a regular wage-paying job.

The starting point of economic activity, as we discussed in Welcome to Economics!, is the division of labor, in

which workers specialize in certain tasks and trade the fruits of their labor with others. Workers who are not

connected to a labor market are often unable to specialize very much. Because these workers are not

“officially” employed, they are often not eligible for social benefits like unemployment insurance or old-age

payments—if such payments are even available in their country. Helping these workers to become more

connected to the labor market and the economy is an important policy goal. Recent research by development

economists suggests that one of the key factors in raising people in low-income countries out of the worst kind

of poverty is whether they can make a connection to a somewhat regular wage-paying job.

Economist Sir W. Arthur Lewis examined such transitions of labor and the impact on economic development.

His core theoretical framework—the dual sector economy—proposes that, essentially, the marginal product of

low-skilled workers is greater in the manufacturing sector than it is in the agricultural sector. That’s because

most agricultural societies are both mature and have fixed inputs (land, water, and related resources); the

marginal product of additional farmers on that land is nearly zero, creating what Lewis termed “surplus

workers.” Early-stage manufacturing sectors, however, have great need for low-skilled workers, and can make

better use (greater marginal product) of them. Their wages will remain low, but as stated above, the wages are

more likely to be consistent and therefore move toward a large-scale transition of the labor force.

We have seen this practically in many nations experiencing a shift in labor, particularly in China. In many

regions, it is marked by a level of migration—people leaving rural areas for cities or manufacturing zones. At

some point, nations achieve what economists call the Lewis turning point, in which the surplus agricultural

labor is fully absorbed into the manufacturing sector. Typically, when this occurs, wages in both agricultural

and manufacturing sectors begin to rise in a sustainable manner. Despite massive transformation in the

Chinese economy over the past decades, economists dispute whether China has actually reached the Lewis

19.4 • Causes of Inflation in Various Countries and Regions 469

turning point.

Economic transition is not without its downsides. Many manufacturing-focused countries still rely heavily on

their agricultural sectors for their own sustenance and as a core part of international trade. As the agricultural

sector faces competition from manufacturing, and as people physically leave rural areas, farming economies

can suffer downturns and unpredictability. Finally, countries or individual farmers seeking to make up for

their missing labor may encourage migration and/or immigration that may cause political or financial conflict.

19.4 Causes of Inflation in Various Countries and Regions

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•

Identify the causes and effects of inflation in various economic markets

• Explain the significance of a converging economy

Policymakers of the high-income economies appear to have learned some lessons about fighting inflation.

First, whatever happens with aggregate supply and aggregate demand in the short run, countries can use

monetary policy to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched in the economy in the medium and long term.

Second, there is no long-run gain to letting inflation become established. In fact, allowing inflation to become
lasting and persistent poses undesirable risks and tradeoffs. When inflation is high, businesses and

individuals need to spend time and effort worrying about protecting themselves against inflation, rather than

seeking better ways to serve customers. In short, the high-income economies appear to have both a political

consensus to hold inflation low and the economic tools to do so. Despite this, periods of growing inflation can

stagnate economic growth and lead to significant political consequences for leaders. In 2022, the U.S. inflation

rate reached 9.1%, an unexpected peak that the country hadn't seen since 1981. As is often the case, President

Joe Biden was held politically responsible, and negotiated with Congress to pass a massive economic and

climate bill titled the Inflation Reduction Act.

In a number of middle- and low-income economies around the world, inflation is far from a solved problem. In

the early 2000s, Turkey experienced inflation of more than 50% per year for several years and continues to

experience high inflation today. Belarus had inflation of about 100% per year from 2000 to 2001. From 2008 to

2010, Venezuela and Myanmar had inflation rates of 20% to 30% per year. Indonesia, Iran, Nigeria, the Russian

Federation, and Ukraine all had double-digit inflation for most of the years from 2000 to 2010. Zimbabwe had

hyperinflation, with inflation rates that went from more than 100% per year in the mid-2000s to a rate of

several million percent in 2008.

In these countries, the problem of very high inflation generally arises from huge budget deficits, which the

government finances by printing its domestic currency. This is a case of “too much money chasing too few

goods.” In the case of Venezuela, beginning in 2016 the government covered its widening deficits by printing

ever higher currency notes, with inflation reaching 1,000,000% by 2018. The crisis continues today, with high

rates of inflation and high unemployment (over 40%). There is some discussion of dollarization, or a

conversion from Venezuelan bolivars to U.S. dollars as the main currency, as a solution to the hyperinflation.

Even in 2019, over 50% of transactions in Venezuela were reportedly using U.S. dollars, and banks issued debit

cards denominated in U.S. dollars in 2021.

A number of countries have managed to sustain solid levels of economic growth for sustained periods of time

with inflation levels that would sound high by recent U.S. standards, like 10% to 30% per year. In such

economies, the governments index most contracts, wage levels, and interest rates to inflation. Indexing wage

contracts and interest rates means that they will increase when inflation increases to retain purchasing power.

When wages do not rise as price levels rise, this leads to a decline in the real wage rate and a decrease in the

standard of living. Likewise, interest rates that are not indexed mean that money lenders will receive payment

in devalued currency and will also lose purchasing power on monies that they lent. It is clearly possible—and

perhaps sometimes necessary—for a converging economy (the economy of a country that demonstrates the

470 19 • Macroeconomic Policy Around the World

ability to catch up to the technology leaders) to live with a degree of uncertainty over inflation that would be

politically unacceptable in the high-income economies.

19.5 Balance of Trade Concerns

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain the meaning of trade balance and its implications for the foreign exchange market

• Analyze concerns over international trade in goods and services and international flows of capital

•

Identify and evaluate market-oriented economic reforms

In the 1950s and 1960s, and even into the 1970s, low- and middle-income countries often viewed openness to

global flows of goods, services, and financial capital in a negative light. These countries feared that foreign

trade would mean both economic losses as high-income trading partners "exploited" their economy and they

lost domestic political control to powerful business interests and multinational corporations.

These negative feelings about international trade have evolved. After all, the great economic success stories of

recent years like Japan, the East Asian Tiger economies, China, and India, all took advantage of opportunities

to sell in global markets. European economies thrive with high levels of trade. In the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA), 1 the United States, Canada, and Mexico pledged themselves to reduce trade
barriers. Many countries have clearly learned that reducing barriers to trade is at least potentially beneficial to

the economy. Many smaller world economies have learned an even tougher lesson: if they do not participate

actively in world trade, they are unlikely to join the success stories among the converging economies. There

are no examples in world history of small economies that remained apart from the global economy but still

attained a high standard of living.

Although almost every country now claims that its goal is to participate in global trade, the possible negative

consequences have remained highly controversial. It is useful to divide these possible negative consequences

into issues involving trade of goods and services and issues involving international capital flows. These issues

are related, but not the same. An economy may have a high level of trade in goods and services relative to GDP,

but if exports and imports are balanced, the net flow of foreign investment in and out of the economy will be

zero. Conversely, an economy may have only a moderate level of trade relative to GDP, but find that it has a

substantial current account trade imbalance. Thus, it is useful to consider the concerns over international

trade of goods and services and international flows of financial capital separately.

Concerns over International Trade in Goods and Services

There is a long list of worries about foreign trade in goods and services: fear of job loss, environmental

dangers, unfair labor practices, and many other concerns. We discuss these arguments at some length in the
chapter on The International Trade and Capital Flows.

Of all of the arguments for limitations on trade, perhaps the most controversial one among economists is the

infant industry argument; that is, subsidizing or protecting new industries for a time until they become

established. (Globalization and Protectionism explains this concept in more detail.) Countries have used such

policies with some success at certain points in time, but in the world as a whole, support for key industries is

far more often directed at long-established industries with substantial political power that are suffering losses

and laying off workers, rather than potentially vibrant new industries that are not yet established. If

government intends to favor certain industries, it needs to do so in a way that is temporary and that orients

them toward a future of market competition, rather than a future of unending government subsidies and trade

protection.

19.5 • Balance of Trade Concerns 471

Concerns over International Flows of Capital

Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that a trade deficit exists when a nation’s imports exceed its

exports. In order for a trade deficit to take place, foreign countries must provide loans or investments, which

they are willing to do because they expect eventual repayment (that the deficit will become a surplus). A trade

surplus, you may remember, exists when a nation’s exports exceed its imports. Thus, in order for a trade deficit

to switch to a trade surplus, a nation’s exports must rise and its imports must fall. Sometimes this happens

when the currency decreases in value. For example, if the U.S. had a trade deficit and the dollar depreciated,

imports would become more expensive. This would, in turn, benefit the foreign countries that provided the

loans or investments.

The expected pattern of trade imbalances in the world economy has been that high-income economies will run

trade surpluses, which means they will experience a net outflow of capital to foreign destinations or export

more than they import, while low- and middle-income economies will run trade deficits, which means that

they will experience a net inflow of foreign capital.

This international investing pattern can benefit all sides. Investors in the high-income countries benefit

because they can receive high returns on their investments, and also because they can diversify their

investments so that they are at less risk of a downturn in their own domestic economy. The low-income

economies that receive an inflow of capital presumably have potential for rapid catch-up economic growth,

and they can use the international financial capital inflow to help spur their physical capital investment. In

addition, financial capital inflows often come with management abilities, technological expertise, and training.

However, for the last couple of decades, this cheerful scenario has faced two “dark clouds.” The first cloud is

the very large trade or current account deficits in the U.S. economy. (See The International Trade and Capital

Flows.) Instead of offering net financial investment abroad, the U.S. economy is soaking up savings from all

over the world. These substantial U.S. trade deficits may not be sustainable according to Sebastian Edwards

writing for the National Bureau of Economic Research. While trade deficits on their own are not bad, the

question is whether governments will reduce them gradually or hastily. In the gradual scenario, U.S. exports

could grow more rapidly than imports over a period of years, aided by U.S. dollar depreciation. An unintended

consequence of the slow growth since the Great Recession has been a decline in the U.S. current account

deficit's from 6% pre-recession to 3% most recently.

The other option is that the government could reduce the U.S. trade deficit in a rush. Here is one scenario: if

foreign investors became less willing to hold U.S. dollar assets, the dollar exchange rate could weaken. As

speculators see this process happening, they might rush to unload their dollar assets, which would drive the

dollar down still further.

A lower U.S. dollar would stimulate aggregate demand by making exports cheaper and imports more

expensive. It would mean higher prices for imported inputs throughout the economy, shifting the short-term

aggregate supply curve to the left. The result could be a burst of inflation and, if the Federal Reserve were to

run a tight monetary policy to reduce the inflation, it could also lead to recession. People sometimes talk as if

the U.S. economy, with its great size, is invulnerable to this sort of pressure from international markets. While

it is difficult to rock, it is not impossible for the $17 trillion U.S. economy to face these international pressures.

The second “dark cloud” is how the smaller world economies should deal with the possibility of sudden foreign

financial capital inflows and outflows. Perhaps the most vivid recent example of the potentially destructive

forces of international capital movements occurred in the East Asian Tiger economies in 1997–1998. Thanks

to their excellent growth performance over the previous few decades, these economies had attracted

considerable interest from foreign investors. In the mid-1990s, however, foreign investment into these

countries surged even further. Much of this money funneled through banks that borrowed in U.S. dollars and

loaned in their national currencies. Bank lending surged at rates of 20% per year or more. This inflow of

foreign capital meant that investment in these economies exceeded the level of domestic savings, so that

472 19 • Macroeconomic Policy Around the World

current account deficits in these countries jumped into the 5–10% GDP range.

The surge in bank lending meant that many banks in these East Asian countries did not do an especially good

job of screening out safe and unsafe borrowers. Many of the loans—as high as 10% to 15% of all loans in some

of these countries—started to turn bad. Fearing losses, foreign investors started pulling out their money. As the

foreign money left, the exchange rates of these countries crashed, often falling by 50% or more in a few

months. The banks were stuck with a mismatch: even if the rest of their domestic loans were repaid, they could

never pay back the U.S. dollars that they owed. The banking sector as a whole went bankrupt. The lack of credit

and lending in the economy collapsed aggregate demand, bringing on a deep recession.

If the flow and ebb of international capital markets can flip even the economies of the East Asian Tigers, with

their stellar growth records, into a recession, then it is no wonder that other middle- and low-income countries

around the world are concerned. Moreover, similar episodes of an inflow and then an outflow of foreign

financial capital have rocked a number of economies around the world: for example, in the last few years,

economies like Ireland, Iceland, and Greece have all experienced severe shocks when foreign lenders decided

to stop extending funds. Especially in Greece, this caused the government to enact austerity measures which

led to protests throughout the country (Figure 19.7).

FIGURE 19.7 Protests in Greece The economic conditions in Greece have deteriorated from the Great Recession

such that the government had to enact austerity measures, (strict rules) cutting wages and increasing taxes on its

population. Massive protests are but one byproduct. (Credit: modification of work by Apostolos/Flickr Creative

Many nations are taking steps to reduce the risk that their economy will be injured if foreign financial capital

takes flight, including having their central banks hold large reserves of foreign exchange and stepping up their

regulation of domestic banks to avoid a wave of imprudent lending. The most controversial steps in this area

involve whether countries should try to take steps to control or reduce the flows of foreign capital. If a country

could discourage some speculative short-term capital inflow, and instead only encourage investment capital

that it committed for the medium and the long term, then it could be at least somewhat less susceptible to

swings in the sentiments of global investors.

If economies participate in the global trade of goods and services, they will also need to participate in

international flows of financial payments and investments. These linkages can offer great benefits to an

economy. However, any nation that is experiencing a substantial and sustained pattern of trade deficits, along

with the corresponding net inflow of international financial capital, has some reason for concern. During the

Asian Financial Crisis in the late 1990s, countries that grew dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis as

international capital flowed in, saw their economies collapse when the capital very quickly flowed out.

Market-Oriented Economic Reforms

The standard of living has increased dramatically for billions of people around the world in the last half

century. Such increases have occurred not only in the technological leaders like the United States, Canada, the

nations of Europe, and Japan, but also in the East Asian Tigers and in many nations of Latin America and

Eastern Europe. The challenge for most of these countries is to maintain these growth rates. The economically-

challenged regions of the world have stagnated and become stuck in poverty traps. These countries need to

focus on the basics: health and education, or human capital development. As Figure 19.8 illustrates, modern

technology allows for the investment in education and human capital development in ways that would have not

been possible just a few short years ago.

FIGURE 19.8 Solar-powered Technology Modern technologies, such as solar-power and Wi-Fi, enable students to

obtain education even in remote parts of a country without electricity. These students in Ghana are sharing a laptop

Other than the issue of economic growth, the other three main goals of macroeconomic policy—that is, low

unemployment, low inflation, and a sustainable balance of trade—all involve situations in which, for some

reason, the economy fails to coordinate the forces of supply and demand. In the case of cyclical

unemployment, for example, the intersection of aggregate supply and aggregate demand occurs at a level of

output below potential GDP. In the case of the natural rate of unemployment, government regulations create a

situation where otherwise-willing employers become unwilling to hire otherwise-willing workers. Inflation is a

situation in which aggregate demand outstrips aggregate supply, at least for a time, so that too much buying

power is chasing too few goods. A trade imbalance is a situation where, because of a net inflow or outflow of

foreign capital, domestic savings are not aligned with domestic investment. Each of these situations can create

a range of easier or harder policy choices.

Youth Unemployment
Spain and South Africa had the same high youth unemployment in 2020, but the reasons for this unemployment are

different. Spain’s current account balance is negative, which means it is borrowing heavily. To cure cyclical

unemployment during a recession, the Keynesian model suggests increases in government spending—fiscal
expansion or monetary expansion. Neither option is open to Spain. It currently can borrow at only high interest

rates, which will be a real problem in terms of debt service. In addition, the rest of the European Union (EU) has

dragged its feet when it comes to debt forgiveness. Monetary expansion is not possible because Spain uses the euro

and cannot devalue its currency unless it convinces all of the EU to do so. What can be done? The Economist,

474 19 • Macroeconomic Policy Around the World

summarizing some ideas of economists and policymakers, suggests that Spain’s only realistic (although painful)

option is to reduce government-mandated wages, which would allow it to reduce government spending. As a result,

the government would be able to lower tax rates on the working population. With a lower wage or lower tax

environment, firms will hire more workers. This will lower unemployment and stimulate the economy. Spain can also

encourage greater foreign investment and try to promote policies that encourage domestic savings.

South Africa has more of a natural rate of unemployment problem. It is an interesting case because its youth

unemployment is mostly because its young are not ready to work. Economists commonly refer to this as an

employability problem. According to interviews of South African firms as reported in the Economist, the young are

academically smart but lack practical skills for the workplace. Despite a big push to increase investment in human

capital, the results have not yet borne fruit. Recently the government unveiled a plan to pay unemployed youth while

they were “trained-up” or apprenticed in South African firms. The government has room to increase fiscal

expenditure, encourage domestic savings, and continue to fund investment in education, vocational training, and

apprentice programs. South Africa can also improve the climate for foreign investment from technology leaders,

which would encourage economic growth.

India has a smaller youth employment problem in terms of percentages. However, bear in mind that since this is a
populous country, it turns out to be a significant problem in raw numbers. According to Kaushik Basu, writing for the
BBC, “there are 45 national laws governing the hiring and firing decisions of firms and close to four times that

amount at the state level”. These laws make it difficult for companies to fire workers. To stay nimble and responsive

to markets, Indian companies respond to these laws by hiring fewer workers. The Indian government can do much

to solve this problem by adjusting its labor laws. Essentially, the government has to remove itself from firms’ hiring

and firing decisions, so that growing Indian firms can freely employ more workers. Indian workers, like those in

South Africa, do not have workforce skills. Again, the government can increase its spending on education, vocational

training, and workforce readiness programs.

Finally, India has a significant current account deficit. This deficit is mainly a result of short- and long-term capital

flows. To solve this deficit, India has experimented by lifting the limitation on domestic savers from investing

abroad. This is a step in the right direction that may dampen the growth in the current account deficit. A final policy

possibility is to improve domestic capital markets so many self-employed Indians can obtain access to capital to

realize their business ideas. If more Indians can obtain access to capital to start businesses, employment might

increase.

some ability, even if not always sustained, to catch up to the technology leaders in high-income countries

Key Concepts and Summary

19.1 The Diversity of Countries and Economies across the World

Macroeconomic policy goals for most countries strive toward low levels of unemployment and inflation, as well

as stable trade balances. Economists analyze countries based on their GDP per person and ranked as low-,

middle-, and high-income countries. Low-income are those earning less than $1,025 (less than 1%) of global

income. They currently have 18.5% of the world population. Middle-income countries are those with per

capital income of $1,025–$12,475 (31.1% of global income). They have 69.5% of world population. High-

income countries are those with per capita income greater than $12,475 (68.3% of global income). They have

12% of the world’s population. Regional comparisons tend to be inaccurate because even countries within

those regions tend to differ from each other.

19.2 Improving Countries’ Standards of Living

The fundamentals of growth are the same in every country: improvements in human capital, physical capital,

and technology interacting in a market-oriented economy. Countries that are high-income tend to focus on

developing and using new technology. Countries that are middle-income focus on increasing human capital

and becoming more connected to technology and global markets. They have charted unconventional paths by

relying more on state-led support rather than relying solely on markets. Low-income, economically-challenged

countries have many health and human development needs, but they are also challenged by the lack of

investment and foreign aid to develop infrastructure like roads. There are some bright spots when it comes to

financial development and mobile communications, which suggest that low-income countries can become

technology leaders in their own right, but it is too early to claim victory. These countries must do more to

connect to the rest of the global economy and find the technologies that work best for them.

19.3 Causes of Unemployment around the World

We can address cyclical unemployment by expansionary fiscal and monetary policy. The natural rate of

unemployment can be harder to solve, because it involves thinking carefully about the tradeoffs involved in

laws that affect employment and hiring. Unemployment is understood differently in high-income countries

compared to low- and middle-income countries. People in these countries are not “unemployed” in the sense

that we use the term in the United States and Europe, but neither are they employed in a regular wage-paying

job. While some may have regular wage-paying jobs, others are part of a barter economy.

19.4 Causes of Inflation in Various Countries and Regions

Most high-income economies have learned that their central banks can control inflation in the medium and

the long term. In addition, they have learned that inflation has no long-term benefits but potentially

476 19 • Self-Check Questions

substantial long-term costs if it distracts businesses from focusing on real productivity gains. However,

smaller economies around the world may face more volatile inflation because their smaller economies can be

unsettled by international movements of capital and goods.

19.5 Balance of Trade Concerns

There are many legitimate concerns over possible negative consequences of free trade. Perhaps the single

strongest response to these concerns is that there are good ways to address them without restricting trade and

thus losing its benefits. There are two major issues involving trade imbalances. One is what will happen with

the large U.S. trade deficits, and whether they will come down gradually or with a rush. The other is whether

smaller countries around the world should take some steps to limit flows of international capital, in the hope

that they will not be quite so susceptible to economic whiplash from international financial capital flowing in

and out of their economies.

Introduction to International Trade

Just Whose iPhone Is It?
The iPhone is a global product. Apple does not manufacture the iPhone components, nor does it assemble them.

The assembly is done by Foxconn Corporation, a Taiwanese company, at its factories in China and India. But,

Samsung, the electronics firm and competitor to Apple, actually supplies many of the parts that make up an iPhone.

In earlier models, Samsung parts made up as much as 26% of the total costs of production. And in more recent

versions, Samsung manufactures the displays and cameras. In some ways, then, Samsung is both the biggest

480 20 • International Trade

supplier and biggest competitor for Apple. Why do these two firms work together to produce the iPhone? To

understand the economic logic behind international trade, you have to accept, as these firms do, that trade is about

mutually beneficial exchange. Samsung is one of the world’s largest electronics parts suppliers. Apple lets Samsung

focus on making the best parts, which allows Apple to concentrate on its strength—designing elegant products that

are easy to use. If each company (and by extension each country) focuses on what it does best, there will be gains

for all through trade.

We live in a global marketplace. The food on your table might include fresh fruit from Chile, cheese from

France, and bottled water from Scotland. Your wireless phone might have been made in Taiwan or Korea. The

clothes you wear might be designed in Italy and manufactured in China. The toys you give to a child might have

come from India. The car you drive might come from Japan, Germany, or Korea. The gasoline in the tank might

be refined from crude oil from Saudi Arabia, Mexico, or Nigeria. As a worker, if your job is involved with

farming, machinery, airplanes, cars, scientific instruments, or many other technology-related industries, the

odds are good that a hearty proportion of the sales of your employer—and hence the money that pays your

salary—comes from export sales. We are all linked by international trade, and the volume of that trade has

grown dramatically in the last few decades.

The first wave of globalization started in the nineteenth century and lasted up to the beginning of World War I.

Over that time, global exports as a share of global GDP rose from less than 1% of GDP in 1820 to 9% of GDP in

1913. As the Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman of Princeton University wrote in 1995:

It is a late-twentieth-century conceit that we invented the global economy just yesterday. In fact, world

markets achieved an impressive degree of integration during the second half of the nineteenth

century. Indeed, if one wants a specific date for the beginning of a truly global economy, one might

well choose 1869, the year in which both the Suez Canal and the Union Pacific railroad were

completed. By the eve of the First World War steamships and railroads had created markets for

standardized commodities, like wheat and wool, that were fully global in their reach. Even the global

flow of information was better than modern observers, focused on electronic technology, tend to

realize: the first submarine telegraph cable was laid under the Atlantic in 1858, and by 1900 all of the

world’s major economic regions could effectively communicate instantaneously.

This first wave of globalization crashed to a halt early in the twentieth century. World War I severed many

economic connections. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, many nations misguidedly tried to fix their

own economies by reducing foreign trade with others. World War II further hindered international trade.

Global flows of goods and financial capital were rebuilt only slowly after World War II. It was not until the early

1980s that global economic forces again became as important, relative to the size of the world economy, as

they were before World War I.

20.1 Absolute and Comparative Advantage

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Define absolute advantage, comparative advantage, and opportunity costs

• Explain the gains of trade created when a country specializes

The American statesman Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) once wrote: “No nation was ever ruined by trade.”

Many economists would express their attitudes toward international trade in an even more positive manner.

The evidence that international trade confers overall benefits on economies is pretty strong. Trade has

accompanied economic growth in the United States and around the world. Many of the national economies

that have shown the most rapid growth in the last several decades—for example, Japan, South Korea, China,

and India—have done so by dramatically orienting their economies toward international trade. There is no

modern example of a country that has shut itself off from world trade and yet prospered. To understand the

Access for free at openstax.org

20.1 • Absolute and Comparative Advantage 481

benefits of trade, or why we trade in the first place, we need to understand the concepts of comparative and

absolute advantage.

In 1817, David Ricardo, a businessman, economist, and member of the British Parliament, wrote a treatise

called On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation. In this treatise, Ricardo argued that specialization

and free trade benefit all trading partners, even those that may be relatively inefficient. To see what he meant,

we must be able to distinguish between absolute and comparative advantage.

A country has an absolute advantage over another country in producing a good if it uses fewer resources to

produce that good. Absolute advantage can be the result of a country’s natural endowment. For example,

extracting oil in Saudi Arabia is pretty much just a matter of “drilling a hole.” Producing oil in other countries

can require considerable exploration and costly technologies for drilling and extraction—if they have any oil at

all. The United States has some of the richest farmland in the world, making it easier to grow corn and wheat

than in many other countries. Guatemala and Colombia have climates especially suited for growing coffee.

Chile and Zambia have some of the world’s richest copper mines. As some have argued, “geography is destiny.”

Chile will provide copper and Guatemala will produce coffee, and they will trade. When each country has a

product others need and it can produce it with fewer resources in one country than in another, then it is easy to
imagine all parties benefitting from trade. However, thinking about trade just in terms of geography and
absolute advantage is incomplete. Trade really occurs because of comparative advantage.

Recall from the chapter Choice in a World of Scarcity that a country has a comparative advantage when it can

produce a good at a lower cost in terms of other goods. The question each country or company should be

asking when it trades is this: “What do we give up to produce this good?” It should be no surprise that the

concept of comparative advantage is based on this idea of opportunity cost from Choice in a World of Scarcity.

For example, if Zambia focuses its resources on producing copper, it cannot use its labor, land and financial

resources to produce other goods such as corn. As a result, Zambia gives up the opportunity to produce corn.

How do we quantify the cost in terms of other goods? Simplify the problem and assume that Zambia just needs

labor to produce copper and corn. The companies that produce either copper or corn tell you that it takes two

hours to mine a ton of copper and one hour to harvest a bushel of corn. This means the opportunity cost of

producing a ton of copper is two bushels of corn. The next section develops absolute and comparative

advantage in greater detail and relates them to trade.

A Numerical Example of Absolute and Comparative Advantage

Consider a hypothetical world with two countries, Saudi Arabia and the United States, and two products, oil

and corn. Further assume that consumers in both countries desire both these goods. These goods are

homogeneous, meaning that consumers/producers cannot differentiate between corn or oil from either

country. There is only one resource available in both countries, labor hours. Saudi Arabia can produce oil with

fewer resources, while the United States can produce corn with fewer resources. Table 20.1 illustrates the

advantages of the two countries, expressed in terms of how many hours it takes to produce one unit of each

good.

TABLE 20.1 How Many Hours It Takes to Produce Oil and Corn

In Table 20.1, Saudi Arabia has an absolute advantage in producing oil because it only takes an hour to

produce a barrel of oil compared to two hours in the United States. The United States has an absolute

advantage in producing corn.

To simplify, let’s say that Saudi Arabia and the United States each have 100 worker hours (see Table 20.2).

Figure 20.2 illustrates what each country is capable of producing on its own using a production possibility

frontier (PPF) graph. Recall from Choice in a World of Scarcity that the production possibilities frontier shows

the maximum amount that each country can produce given its limited resources, in this case workers, and its

level of technology.

FIGURE 20.2 Production Possibilities Frontiers (a) Saudi Arabia can produce 100 barrels of oil at maximum and

zero corn (point A), or 25 bushels of corn and zero oil (point B). It can also produce other combinations of oil and

corn if it wants to consume both goods, such as at point C. Here it chooses to produce/consume 60 barrels of oil,

leaving 40 work hours that to allocate to produce 10 bushels of corn, using the data in Table 20.1. (b) If the United

States produces only oil, it can produce, at maximum, 50 barrels and zero corn (point A'), or at the other extreme, it

can produce a maximum of 100 bushels of corn and no oil (point B'). Other combinations of both oil and corn are

possible, such as point C'. All points above the frontiers are impossible to produce given the current level of

resources and technology.

Arguably Saudi and U.S. consumers desire both oil and corn to live. Let’s say that before trade occurs, both

countries produce and consume at point C or C'. Thus, before trade, the Saudi Arabian economy will devote 60

worker hours to produce oil, as Table 20.3 shows. Given the information in Table 20.1, this choice implies that

it produces/consumes 60 barrels of oil. With the remaining 40 worker hours, since it needs four hours to

produce a bushel of corn, it can produce only 10 bushels. To be at point C', the U.S. economy devotes 40 worker

hours to produce 20 barrels of oil and it can allocate the remaining worker hours to produce 60 bushels of

corn.

The slope of the production possibility frontier illustrates the opportunity cost of producing oil in terms of

corn. Using all its resources, the United States can produce 50 barrels of oil or100 bushels of corn; therefore,

the opportunity cost of one barrel of oil is two bushels of corn—or the slope is 1/2. Thus, in the U.S. production

possibility frontier graph, every increase in oil production of one barrel implies a decrease of two bushels of

corn. Saudi Arabia can produce 100 barrels of oil or25 bushels of corn. The opportunity cost of producing one

barrel of oil is the loss of 1/4 of a bushel of corn that Saudi workers could otherwise have produced. In terms of

corn, notice that Saudi Arabia gives up the least to produce a barrel of oil. Table 20.4 summarizes these

calculations.

TABLE 20.4 Opportunity Cost and Comparative Advantage

Again recall that we defined comparative advantage as the opportunity cost of producing goods. Since Saudi

Arabia gives up the least to produce a barrel of oil, ( < in Table 20.4) it has a comparative advantage in oil

production. The United States gives up the least to produce a bushel of corn, so it has a comparative advantage

in corn production.

In this example, there is symmetry between absolute and comparative advantage. Saudi Arabia needs fewer

worker hours to produce oil (absolute advantage, see Table 20.1), and also gives up the least in terms of other

goods to produce oil (comparative advantage, see Table 20.4). Such symmetry is not always the case, as we will

show after we have discussed gains from trade fully, but first, read the following Clear It Up feature to make

sure you understand why the PPF line in the graphs is straight.

484 20 • International Trade

CLEAR IT UP

Can a production possibility frontier be straight?
When you first met the production possibility frontier (PPF) in the chapter on Choice in a World of Scarcity we drew it

with an outward-bending shape. This shape illustrated that as we transferred inputs from producing one good to

another—like from education to health services—there were increasing opportunity costs. In the examples in this

chapter, we draw the PPFs as straight lines, which means that opportunity costs are constant. When we transfer a

marginal unit of labor away from growing corn and toward producing oil, the decline in the quantity of corn and the

increase in the quantity of oil is always the same. In reality this is possible only if the contribution of additional

workers to output did not change as the scale of production changed. The linear production possibilities frontier is a

less realistic model, but a straight line simplifies calculations. It also illustrates economic themes like absolute and

comparative advantage just as clearly.

Gains from Trade

Consider the trading positions of the United States and Saudi Arabia after they have specialized and traded.
Before trade, Saudi Arabia produces/consumes 60 barrels of oil and 10 bushels of corn. The United States

produces/consumes 20 barrels of oil and 60 bushels of corn. Given their current production levels, if the

United States can trade an amount of corn fewer than 60 bushels and receive in exchange an amount of oil

greater than 20 barrels, it will gain from trade. With trade, the United States can consume more of both goods

than it did without specialization and trade. (Recall that the chapter Welcome to Economics! defined

specialization as it applies to workers and firms. Economists also use specialization to describe the occurrence

when a country shifts resources to focus on producing a good that offers comparative advantage.) Similarly, if

Saudi Arabia can trade an amount of oil less than 60 barrels and receive in exchange an amount of corn

greater than 10 bushels, it will have more of both goods than it did before specialization and trade. Table 20.5

illustrates the range of trades that would benefit both sides.

Imports at least 10 bushels of corn

Imports at least 20 barrels of oil

Exports less than 60 barrels of oil

TABLE 20.5 The Range of Trades That Benefit Both the United States and Saudi Arabia

The underlying reason why trade benefits both sides is rooted in the concept of opportunity cost, as the

following Clear It Up feature explains. If Saudi Arabia wishes to expand domestic production of corn in a world

without international trade, then based on its opportunity costs it must give up four barrels of oil for every one

additional bushel of corn. If Saudi Arabia could find a way to give up less than four barrels of oil for an

additional bushel of corn (or equivalently, to receive more than one bushel of corn for four barrels of oil), it

would be better off.

CLEAR IT UP

What are the opportunity costs and gains from trade?
The range of trades that will benefit each country is based on the country’s opportunity cost of producing each good.

The United States can produce 100 bushels of corn or 50 barrels of oil. For the United States, the opportunity cost of

producing one barrel of oil is two bushels of corn. If we divide the numbers above by 50, we get the same ratio: one

Access for free at openstax.org

20.1 • Absolute and Comparative Advantage 485

barrel of oil is equivalent to two bushels of corn, or (100/50 = 2 and 50/50 = 1). In a trade with Saudi Arabia, if the

United States is going to give up 100 bushels of corn in exports, it must import at least 50 barrels of oil to be just as

well off. Clearly, to gain from trade it needs to be able to gain more than a half barrel of oil for its bushel of corn—or

why trade at all?

Recall that David Ricardo argued that if each country specializes in its comparative advantage, it will benefit

from trade, and total global output will increase. How can we show gains from trade as a result of comparative

advantage and specialization? Table 20.6 shows the output assuming that each country specializes in its

comparative advantage and produces no other good. This is 100% specialization. Specialization leads to an

increase in total world production. (Compare the total world production in Table 20.3 to that in Table 20.6.)

What if we did not have complete specialization, as in Table 20.6? Would there still be gains from trade?

Consider another example, such as when the United States and Saudi Arabia start at C and C', respectively, as

Figure 20.2 shows. Consider what occurs when trade is allowed and the United States exports 20 bushels of

corn to Saudi Arabia in exchange for 20 barrels of oil.

FIGURE 20.3 Production Possibilities Frontier in Saudi Arabia Trade allows a country to go beyond its domestic

production-possibility frontier

486 20 • International Trade

Starting at point C, which shows Saudi oil production of 60, reduce Saudi oil domestic oil consumption by 20,

since 20 is exported to the United States and exchanged for 20 units of corn. This enables Saudi to reach point

D, where oil consumption is now 40 barrels and corn consumption has increased to 30 (see Figure 20.3).

Notice that even without 100% specialization, if the “trading price,” in this case 20 barrels of oil for 20 bushels

of corn, is greater than the country’s opportunity cost, the Saudis will gain from trade. Since the post-trade

consumption point D is beyond its production possibility frontier, Saudi Arabia has gained from trade.

20.2 What Happens When a Country Has an Absolute Advantage in All Goods

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Show the relationship between production costs and comparative advantage

•

•

Identify situations of mutually beneficial trade

Identify trade benefits by considering opportunity costs

What happens to the possibilities for trade if one country has an absolute advantage in everything? This is

typical for high-income countries that often have well-educated workers, technologically advanced equipment,

and the most up-to-date production processes. These high-income countries can produce all products with

fewer resources than a low-income country. If the high-income country is more productive across the board,

will there still be gains from trade? Good students of Ricardo understand that trade is about mutually

beneficial exchange. Even when one country has an absolute advantage in all products, trade can still benefit

both sides. This is because gains from trade come from specializing in one’s comparative advantage.

Production Possibilities and Comparative Advantage

Consider the example of trade between the United States and Mexico described in Table 20.7. In this example,

it takes four U.S. workers to produce 1,000 pairs of shoes, but it takes five Mexican workers to do so. It takes

one U.S. worker to produce 1,000 refrigerators, but it takes four Mexican workers to do so. The United States

has an absolute advantage in productivity with regard to both shoes and refrigerators; that is, it takes fewer

workers in the United States than in Mexico to produce both a given number of shoes and a given number of

refrigerators.

TABLE 20.7 Resources Needed to Produce Shoes and Refrigerators

Absolute advantage simply compares the productivity of a worker between countries. It answers the question,

“How many inputs do I need to produce shoes in Mexico?” Comparative advantage asks this same question

slightly differently. Instead of comparing how many workers it takes to produce a good, it asks, “How much am

I giving up to produce this good in this country?” Another way of looking at this is that comparative advantage

identifies the good for which the producer’s absolute advantage is relatively larger, or where the producer’s

absolute productivity disadvantage is relatively smaller. The United States can produce 1,000 shoes with four-

fifths as many workers as Mexico (four versus five), but it can produce 1,000 refrigerators with only one-

20.2 • What Happens When a Country Has an Absolute Advantage in All Goods 487

quarter as many workers (one versus four). So, the comparative advantage of the United States, where its

absolute productivity advantage is relatively greatest, lies with refrigerators, and Mexico’s comparative

advantage, where its absolute productivity disadvantage is least, is in the production of shoes.

Mutually Beneficial Trade with Comparative Advantage

When nations increase production in their area of comparative advantage and trade with each other, both

countries can benefit. Again, the production possibility frontier is a useful tool to visualize this benefit.

Consider a situation where the United States and Mexico each have 40 workers. For example, as Table 20.8

shows, if the United States divides its labor so that 40 workers are making shoes, then, since it takes four

workers in the United States to make 1,000 shoes, a total of 10,000 shoes will be produced. (If four workers can

make 1,000 shoes, then 40 workers will make 10,000 shoes). If the 40 workers in the United States are making

refrigerators, and each worker can produce 1,000 refrigerators, then a total of 40,000 refrigerators will be

produced.

or 40,000 refrigerators

TABLE 20.8 Production Possibilities before Trade with Complete Specialization

As always, the slope of the production possibility frontier for each country is the opportunity cost of one

refrigerator in terms of foregone shoe production–when labor is transferred from producing the latter to

producing the former (see Figure 20.4).

FIGURE 20.4 Production Possibility Frontiers (a) With 40 workers, the United States can produce either 10,000

shoes and zero refrigerators or 40,000 refrigerators and zero shoes. (b) With 40 workers, Mexico can produce a

maximum of 8,000 shoes and zero refrigerators, or 10,000 refrigerators and zero shoes. All other points on the

production possibility line are possible combinations of the two goods that can be produced given current

resources. Point A on both graphs is where the countries start producing and consuming before trade. Point B is

where they end up after trade.

Let’s say that, in the situation before trade, each nation prefers to produce a combination of shoes and

refrigerators that is shown at point A. Table 20.9 shows the output of each good for each country and the total

488 20 • International Trade

output for the two countries.

TABLE 20.9 Total Production at Point A before Trade

Continuing with this scenario, suppose that each country transfers some amount of labor toward its area of

comparative advantage. For example, the United States transfers six workers away from shoes and toward

producing refrigerators. As a result, U.S. production of shoes decreases by 1,500 units (6/4 × 1,000), while its

production of refrigerators increases by 6,000 (that is, 6/1 × 1,000). Mexico also moves production toward its

area of comparative advantage, transferring 10 workers away from refrigerators and toward production of
shoes. As a result, production of refrigerators in Mexico falls by 2,500 (10/4 × 1,000), but production of shoes
increases by 2,000 pairs (10/5 × 1,000). Notice that when both countries shift production toward each of their

comparative advantages (what they are relatively better at), their combined production of both goods rises, as

shown in Table 20.10. The reduction of shoe production by 1,500 pairs in the United States is more than offset

by the gain of 2,000 pairs of shoes in Mexico, while the reduction of 2,500 refrigerators in Mexico is more than

offset by the additional 6,000 refrigerators produced in the United States.

TABLE 20.10 Shifting Production Toward Comparative

Advantage Raises Total Output

This numerical example illustrates the remarkable insight of comparative advantage: even when one country

has an absolute advantage in all goods and another country has an absolute disadvantage in all goods, both
countries can still benefit from trade. Even though the United States has an absolute advantage in producing

both refrigerators and shoes, it makes economic sense for it to specialize in the good for which it has a

comparative advantage. The United States will export refrigerators and in return import shoes.

How Opportunity Cost Sets the Boundaries of Trade

This example shows that both parties can benefit from specializing in their comparative advantages and

trading. By using the opportunity costs in this example, it is possible to identify the range of possible trades

that would benefit each country.

Mexico started out, before specialization and trade, producing 4,000 pairs of shoes and 5,000 refrigerators (see
Figure 20.4 and Table 20.9). Then, in the numerical example given, Mexico shifted production toward its

comparative advantage and produced 6,000 pairs of shoes but only 2,500 refrigerators. Thus, if Mexico can

export no more than 2,000 pairs of shoes (giving up 2,000 pairs of shoes) in exchange for imports of at least

2,500 refrigerators (a gain of 2,500 refrigerators), it will be able to consume more of both goods than before

trade. Mexico will be unambiguously better off. Conversely, the United States started off, before specialization

Access for free at openstax.org

20.2 • What Happens When a Country Has an Absolute Advantage in All Goods 489

and trade, producing 5,000 pairs of shoes and 20,000 refrigerators. In the example, it then shifted production

toward its comparative advantage, producing only 3,500 shoes but 26,000 refrigerators. If the United States

can export no more than 6,000 refrigerators in exchange for imports of at least 1,500 pairs of shoes, it will be

able to consume more of both goods and will be unambiguously better off.

The range of trades that can benefit both nations is shown in Table 20.11. For example, a trade where the U.S.

exports 4,000 refrigerators to Mexico in exchange for 1,800 pairs of shoes would benefit both sides, in the

sense that both countries would be able to consume more of both goods than in a world without trade.

Exportsno more than 2,000 pairs of shoes

TABLE 20.11 The Range of Trades That Benefit Both the United States and Mexico

Trade allows each country to take advantage of lower opportunity costs in the other country. If Mexico wants to

produce more refrigerators without trade, it must face its domestic opportunity costs and reduce shoe

production. If Mexico, instead, produces more shoes and then trades for refrigerators made in the United

States, where the opportunity cost of producing refrigerators is lower, Mexico can in effect take advantage of

the lower opportunity cost of refrigerators in the United States. Conversely, when the United States specializes

in its comparative advantage of refrigerator production and trades for shoes produced in Mexico, international

trade allows the United States to take advantage of the lower opportunity cost of shoe production in Mexico.

The theory of comparative advantage explains why countries trade: they have different comparative

advantages. It shows that the gains from international trade result from pursuing comparative advantage and

producing at a lower opportunity cost. The following Work It Out feature shows how to calculate absolute and

comparative advantage and the way to apply them to a country’s production.

WORK IT OUT

Calculating Absolute and Comparative Advantage

e.

In this example, is absolute advantage the same as comparative advantage, or not?

In what product should Canada specialize? In what product should Venezuela specialize?

490 20 • International Trade

Step 1. Make a table like Table 20.12.

Step 2. To calculate absolute advantage, look at the larger of the numbers for each product. One worker in

Canada can produce more lumber (40 tons versus 30 tons), so Canada has the absolute advantage in lumber.

One worker in Venezuela can produce 60 barrels of oil compared to a worker in Canada who can produce only 20.

Step 3. To calculate comparative advantage, find the opportunity cost of producing one barrel of oil in both

countries. The country with the lowest opportunity cost has the comparative advantage. With the same labor

time, Canada can produce either 20 barrels of oil or 40 tons of lumber. So in effect, 20 barrels of oil is equivalent

to 40 tons of lumber: 20 oil = 40 lumber. Divide both sides of the equation by 20 to calculate the opportunity cost

of one barrel of oil in Canada. 20/20 oil = 40/20 lumber. 1 oil = 2 lumber. To produce one additional barrel of oil

in Canada has an opportunity cost of 2 lumber. Calculate the same way for Venezuela: 60 oil = 30 lumber. Divide

both sides of the equation by 60. One oil in Venezuela has an opportunity cost of 1/2 lumber. Because 1/2

lumber < 2 lumber, Venezuela has the comparative advantage in producing oil.

Step 4. Calculate the opportunity cost of one lumber by reversing the numbers, with lumber on the left side of the

equation. In Canada, 40 lumber is equivalent in labor time to 20 barrels of oil: 40 lumber = 20 oil. Divide each

side of the equation by 40. The opportunity cost of one lumber is 1/2 oil. In Venezuela, the equivalent labor time
will produce 30 lumber or 60 oil: 30 lumber = 60 oil. Divide each side by 30. One lumber has an opportunity cost

of two oil. Canada has the lower opportunity cost in producing lumber.

Step 5. In this example, absolute advantage is the same as comparative advantage. Canada has the absolute and

comparative advantage in lumber; Venezuela has the absolute and comparative advantage in oil.

Step 6. Canada should specialize in the commodity for which it has a relative lower opportunity cost, which is

lumber, and Venezuela should specialize in oil. Canada will be exporting lumber and importing oil, and Venezuela

will be exporting oil and importing lumber.

Comparative Advantage Goes Camping

To build an intuitive understanding of how comparative advantage can benefit all parties, set aside examples

that involve national economies for a moment and consider the situation of a group of friends who decide to go

camping together. The six friends have a wide range of skills and experiences, but one person in particular,

Jethro, has done lots of camping before and is also a great athlete. Jethro has an absolute advantage in all

aspects of camping: he is faster at carrying a backpack, gathering firewood, paddling a canoe, setting up tents,

making a meal, and washing up. So here is the question: Because Jethro has an absolute productivity

advantage in everything, should he do all the work?

Of course not! Even if Jethro is willing to work like a mule while everyone else sits around, he, like all mortals,

only has 24 hours in a day. If everyone sits around and waits for Jethro to do everything, not only will Jethro be

an unhappy camper, but there will not be much output for his group of six friends to consume. The theory of

comparative advantage suggests that everyone will benefit if they figure out their areas of comparative

advantage—that is, the area of camping where their productivity disadvantage is least, compared to Jethro. For

example, it may be that Jethro is 80% faster at building fires and cooking meals than anyone else, but only 20%

faster at gathering firewood and 10% faster at setting up tents. In that case, Jethro should focus on building

fires and making meals, and others should attend to the other tasks, each according to where their productivity

disadvantage is smallest. If the campers coordinate their efforts according to comparative advantage, they can

all gain.

20.3 Intra-industry Trade between Similar Economies

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

•

Identify at least two advantages of intra-industry trading

• Explain the relationship between economies of scale and intra-industry trade

Absolute and comparative advantages explain a great deal about global trading patterns. For example, they

help to explain the patterns that we noted at the start of this chapter, like why you may be eating fresh fruit

from Chile or Mexico, or why lower productivity regions like Africa and Latin America are able to sell a

substantial proportion of their exports to higher productivity regions like the European Union and North

America. Comparative advantage, however, at least at first glance, does not seem especially well-suited to

explain other common patterns of international trade.

The Prevalence of Intra-Industry Trade between Similar Economies

The theory of comparative advantage suggests that trade should happen between economies with large

differences in opportunity costs of production. Roughly half of all U.S. trade involves shipping goods between

the fairly similar high-income economies of Japan, Canada, and the United States. Furthermore, the trade has
an important geographic component—the biggest trading partners of the United States are Canada and Mexico

(see Table 20.13).

Moreover, the theory of comparative advantage suggests that each economy should specialize to a degree in
certain products, and then exchange those products. A high proportion of trade, however, is intra-industry

trade—that is, trade of goods within the same industry from one country to another. For example, the United

States produces and exports autos and imports autos. Table 20.14 shows some of the largest categories of U.S.

exports and imports. In all of these categories, the United States is both a substantial exporter and a

substantial importer of goods from the same industry. In 2021, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the

United States exported $131 billion worth of autos, and imported $317 billion worth of autos. About 60% of

U.S. trade and 60% of European trade is intra-industry trade.

TABLE 20.14 Some Intra-Industry U.S. Exports and Imports in 2021 (Source:

https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/data/index.html)

Why do similar high-income economies engage in intra-industry trade? What can be the economic benefit of
having workers of fairly similar skills making cars, computers, machinery and other products which are then

shipped across the oceans to and from the United States, the European Union, and Japan? There are two

reasons: (1) The division of labor leads to learning, innovation, and unique skills; and (2) economies of scale.

Gains from Specialization and Learning

Consider the category of machinery, where the U.S. economy has considerable intra-industry trade. Machinery

comes in many varieties, so the United States may be exporting machinery for manufacturing with wood, but

importing machinery for photographic processing. The underlying reason why a country like the United

States, Japan, or Germany produces one kind of machinery rather than another is usually not related to U.S.,

German, or Japanese firms and workers having generally higher or lower skills. It is just that, in working on

very specific and particular products, firms in certain countries develop unique and different skills.

Specialization in the world economy can be very finely split. In fact, recent years have seen a trend in

international trade, which economists call splitting up the value chain. The value chain describes how a good

is produced in stages. As indicated in the beginning of the chapter, producing the iPhone involves designing

and engineering the phone in the United States, supplying parts from Korea, assembling the parts in China,

and advertising and marketing in the United States. Thanks in large part to improvements in communication

technology, sharing information, and transportation, it has become easier to split up the value chain. Instead

of production in a single large factory, different firms operating in various places and even different countries
can divide the value chain. Because firms split up the value chain, international trade often does not involve

nations trading whole finished products like automobiles or refrigerators. Instead, it involves shipping more

specialized goods like, say, automobile dashboards or the shelving that fits inside refrigerators. Intra-industry

trade between similar countries produces economic gains because it allows workers and firms to learn and

innovate on particular products—and often to focus on very particular parts of the value chain.

of the iPhone.

Economies of Scale, Competition, Variety

A second broad reason that intra-industry trade between similar nations produces economic gains involves

economies of scale. The concept of economies of scale, as we introduced in Production, Costs and Industry

Structure (http://openstax.org/books/principles-economics-3e/pages/7-introduction-to-production-costs-and-

Access for free at openstax.org

20.3 • Intra-industry Trade between Similar Economies 493

industry-structure), means that as the scale of output goes up, average costs of production decline—at least up

to a point. Figure 20.5 illustrates economies of scale for a plant producing toaster ovens. The horizontal axis of

the figure shows the quantity of production by a certain firm or at a certain manufacturing plant. The vertical

axis measures the average cost of production. Production plant S produces a small level of output at 30 units

and has an average cost of production of $30 per toaster oven. Plant M produces at a medium level of output at

50 units, and has an average cost of production of $20 per toaster oven. Plant L produces 150 units of output

with an average cost of production of only $10 per toaster oven. Although plant V can produce 200 units of

output, it still has the same unit cost as Plant L.

In this example, a small or medium plant, like S or M, will not be able to compete in the market with a large or a

very large plant like L or V, because the firm that operates L or V will be able to produce and sell its output at a

lower price. In this example, economies of scale operate up to point L, but beyond point L to V, the additional

scale of production does not continue to reduce average costs of production.

FIGURE 20.5 Economies of Scale Production Plant S, has an average cost of production of $30 per toaster oven.

Production plant M has an average cost of production of $20 per toaster oven. Production plant L has an average

cost of production of only $10 per toaster oven. Production plant V still has an average cost of production of $10 per

toaster oven. Thus, production plant M can produce toaster ovens more cheaply than plant S because of economies

of scale, and plants L or V can produce more cheaply than S or M because of economies of scale. However, the

economies of scale end at an output level of 150. Plant V, despite being larger, cannot produce more cheaply on

average than plant L.

The concept of economies of scale becomes especially relevant to international trade when it enables one or

two large producers to supply the entire country. For example, a single large automobile factory could probably

supply all the cars consumers purchase in a smaller economy like the United Kingdom or Belgium in a given

year. However, if a country has only one or two large factories producing cars, and no international trade, then

consumers in that country would have relatively little choice between kinds of cars (other than the color of the

paint and other nonessential options). Little or no competition will exist between different car manufacturers.

International trade provides a way to combine the lower average production costs that come from economies

of scale and still have competition and variety for consumers. Large automobile factories in different countries

can make and sell their products around the world. If General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler were the only players

in the U.S. automobile market, the level of competition and consumer choice would be considerably lower than

when U.S. carmakers must face competition from Toyota, Honda, Suzuki, Fiat, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Volkswagen,

Kia, Hyundai, BMW, Subaru, and others. Greater competition brings with it innovation and responsiveness to

what consumers want. America’s car producers make far better cars now than they did several decades ago,

and much of the reason is competitive pressure, especially from East Asian and European carmakers.

Dynamic Comparative Advantage

The sources of gains from intra-industry trade between similar economies—namely, the learning that comes

494 20 • International Trade

from a high degree of specialization and splitting up the value chain and from economies of scale—do not

contradict the earlier theory of comparative advantage. Instead, they help to broaden the concept.

In intra-industry trade, climate or geography do not determine the level of worker productivity. Even the

general level of education or skill does not determine it. Instead, how firms engage in specific learning about

specialized products, including taking advantage of economies of scale determine the level of worker

productivity. In this vision, comparative advantage can be dynamic—that is, it can evolve and change over time

as one develops new skills and as manufacturers split the value chain in new ways. This line of thinking also

suggests that countries are not destined to have the same comparative advantage forever, but must instead be

flexible in response to ongoing changes in comparative advantage.

20.4 The Benefits of Reducing Barriers to International Trade

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain tariffs as barriers to trade

•

Identify at least two benefits of reducing barriers to international trade

Tariffs are taxes that governments place on imported goods for a variety of reasons. Some of these reasons
include protecting sensitive industries, for humanitarian reasons, and protecting against dumping.

Traditionally, tariffs were used simply as a political tool to protect certain vested economic, social, and cultural

interests. The World Trade Organization (WTO) is committed to lowering barriers to trade. The world’s nations

meet through the WTO to negotiate how they can reduce barriers to trade, such as tariffs. WTO negotiations

happen in “rounds,” where all countries negotiate one agreement to encourage trade, take a year or two off,

and then start negotiating a new agreement. The current round of negotiations is called the Doha Round

because it was officially launched in Doha, the capital city of Qatar, in November 2001. In 2010, the WTO noted

that the Doha Round’s emphasis on market access and reforms of agricultural subsidies could add $121–$202

billion to the world economy.

In the context of a global economy that currently produces more than $80 trillion of goods and services each

year, this amount is not large: it is an increase of less than 1%. But before dismissing the gains from trade too

quickly, it is worth remembering two points.

• First, a gain of a few hundred billion dollars is enough money to deserve attention! Moreover, remember

that this increase is not a one-time event; it would persist each year into the future.

• Second, the estimate of gains may be on the low side because some of the gains from trade are not

measured especially well in economic statistics. For example, it is difficult to measure the potential

advantages to consumers of having a variety of products available and a greater degree of competition

among producers. Perhaps the most important unmeasured factor is that trade between countries,

especially when firms are splitting up the value chain of production, often involves a transfer of knowledge

that can involve skills in production, technology, management, finance, and law.

Low-income countries benefit more from trade than high-income countries do. In some ways, the giant U.S.

economy has less need for international trade, because it can already take advantage of internal trade within

its economy. However, many smaller national economies around the world, in regions like Latin America,

Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, have much more limited possibilities for trade inside their countries or their

immediate regions. Without international trade, they may have little ability to benefit from comparative

advantage, slicing up the value chain, or economies of scale. Moreover, smaller economies often have fewer

competitive firms making goods within their economy, and thus firms have less pressure from other firms to

provide the goods and prices that consumers want.

The economic gains from expanding international trade are measured in hundreds of billions of dollars, and

the gains from international trade as a whole probably reach well into the trillions of dollars. The potential for

gains from trade may be especially high among the smaller and lower-income countries of the world.

Visit this website (http://openstax.org/l/tradebenefits) for a list of some benefits of trade.

From Interpersonal to International Trade

Most people find it easy to believe that they, personally, would not be better off if they tried to grow and process

all of their own food, to make all of their own clothes, to build their own cars and houses from scratch, and so

on. Instead, we all benefit from living in economies where people and firms can specialize and trade with each

other.

The benefits of trade do not stop at national boundaries, either. Earlier we explained that the division of labor

could increase output for three reasons: (1) workers with different characteristics can specialize in the types of

production where they have a comparative advantage; (2) firms and workers who specialize in a certain

product become more productive with learning and practice; and (3) economies of scale. These three reasons

apply from the individual and community level right up to the international level. If it makes sense to you that

interpersonal, intercommunity, and interstate trade offer economic gains, it should make sense that

international trade offers gains, too.

International trade currently involves about $20 trillion worth of goods and services moving around the globe.

Any economic force of that size, even if it confers overall benefits, is certain to cause disruption and

controversy. This chapter has only made the case that trade brings economic benefits. Other chapters discuss,

in detail, the public policy arguments over whether to restrict international trade.

Just Whose iPhone Is It?
Apple Corporation uses a global platform to produce the iPhone. Now that you understand the concept of

comparative advantage, you can see why the engineering and design of the iPhone is done in the United States. The

United States has built up a comparative advantage over the years in designing and marketing products, and

sacrifices fewer resources to design high-tech devices relative to other countries. China has a comparative

advantage in assembling the phone due to its large skilled labor force. Korea has a comparative advantage in

producing components. Korea focuses its production by increasing its scale, learning better ways to produce

screens and computer chips, and uses innovation to lower average costs of production. Apple, in turn, benefits

because it can purchase these quality products at lower prices. Put the global assembly line together and you have

the device with which we are all so familiar.

Key Concepts and Summary

20.1 Absolute and Comparative Advantage

A country has an absolute advantage in those products in which it has a productivity edge over other countries;

it takes fewer resources to produce a product. A country has a comparative advantage when it can produce a

good at a lower cost in terms of other goods. Countries that specialize based on comparative advantage gain

from trade.

20.2 What Happens When a Country Has an Absolute Advantage in All Goods

Even when a country has high levels of productivity in all goods, it can still benefit from trade. Gains from

trade come about as a result of comparative advantage. By specializing in a good that it gives up the least to

produce, a country can produce more and offer that additional output for sale. If other countries specialize in

the area of their comparative advantage as well and trade, the highly productive country is able to benefit from

a lower opportunity cost of production in other countries.

20.3 Intra-industry Trade between Similar Economies

A large share of global trade happens between high-income economies that are quite similar in having well-

educated workers and advanced technology. These countries practice intra-industry trade, in which they

import and export the same products at the same time, like cars, machinery, and computers. In the case of

intra-industry trade between economies with similar income levels, the gains from trade come from

specialized learning in very particular tasks and from economies of scale. Splitting up the value chain means

that several stages of producing a good take place in different countries around the world.

20.4 The Benefits of Reducing Barriers to International Trade

Tariffs are placed on imported goods as a way of protecting sensitive industries, for humanitarian reasons, and

for protection against dumping. Traditionally, tariffs were used as a political tool to protect certain vested
economic, social, and cultural interests. The WTO has been, and continues to be, a way for nations to meet and

negotiate in order to reduce barriers to trade. The gains of international trade are very large, especially for

smaller countries, but are beneficial to all.

Introduction to Globalization and Protectionism

BRING IT HOME

What’s the Downside of Protection?
Governments are motivated to limit and alter market outcomes for political or social ends. While governments can

limit the rise in prices of some products, they cannot control how much people want to buy or how much firms are

willing to sell. The laws of demand and supply still hold. Trade policy is an example where regulations can redirect

economic forces, but it cannot stop them from manifesting themselves elsewhere.

Flat-panel displays, the displays for laptop computers, tablets, and flat screen televisions, are an example of such

an enduring principle. In the early 1990s, the vast majority of flat-panel displays used in U.S.-manufactured laptops

were imported, primarily from Japan. The small but politically powerful U.S. flat-panel-display industry filed a

502 21 • Globalization and Protectionism

dumping complaint with the Commerce Department. They argued that Japanese firms were selling displays at “less

than fair value,” which made it difficult for U.S. firms to compete. This argument for trade protection is referred to as

anti-dumping. Other arguments for protection in this complaint included national security. After a preliminary

determination by the Commerce Department that the Japanese firms were dumping, the U.S. International Trade

Commission imposed a 63% dumping margin (or tax) on the import of flat-panel displays. Was this a successful

exercise of U.S. trade policy? See what you think after reading the chapter.

The world has become more connected on multiple levels, especially economically. In 1970, imports and

exports made up 11% of U.S. GDP, while now they make up 32%. However, the United States, due to its size, is

less internationally connected than most countries. For example, according to the World Bank, 97% of

Botswana’s economic activity is connected to trade. This chapter explores trade policy—the laws and strategies

a country uses to regulate international trade. This topic is not without controversy.

As the world has become more globally connected, firms and workers in high-income countries like the United

States, Japan, or the nations of the European Union, perceive a competitive threat from firms in medium-

income countries like Mexico, China, or South Africa, that have lower costs of living and therefore pay lower

wages. Firms and workers in low-income countries fear that they will suffer if they must compete against more
productive workers and advanced technology in high-income countries.

On a different tack, some environmentalists worry that multinational firms may evade environmental

protection laws by moving their production to countries with loose or nonexistent pollution standards, trading

a clean environment for jobs. Some politicians worry that their country may become overly dependent on key

imported products, like oil, which in a time of war could threaten national security. All of these fears influence

governments to reach the same basic policy conclusion: to protect national interests, whether businesses, jobs,

or security, imports of foreign products should be restricted. This chapter analyzes such arguments. First,

however, it is essential to learn a few key concepts and understand how the demand and supply model applies

to international trade.

21.1 Protectionism: An Indirect Subsidy from Consumers to Producers

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain protectionism and its three main forms

• Analyze protectionism through concepts of demand and supply, noting its effects on equilibrium

• Calculate the effects of trade barriers

When a government legislates policies to reduce or block international trade it is engaging in protectionism.

Protectionist policies often seek to shield domestic producers and domestic workers from foreign competition.

Protectionism takes three main forms: tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers.

Recall from International Trade that tariffs are taxes that governments impose on imported goods and

services. This makes imports more expensive for consumers, discouraging imports. For example, in 2018,

President Trump increased tariffs on Chinese-manufactured goods by 2–25%, including TVs, monitors,

desktop PCs, smartwatches, and many other consumer goods. The intention behind the policy was to shelter

U.S. manufacturers from competition, helping companies that operate domestically. China responded with

tariffs on American goods, launching a trade war. President Biden retained these tariffs and considered

additional ones, but as of August 2022, the administration was considering changes designed to reduce

inflation.

Another way to control trade is through import quotas, which are numerical limitations on the quantity of

products that a country can import. For instance, during the early 1980s, the Reagan Administration imposed

a quota on the import of Japanese automobiles. In the 1970s, many developed countries, including the United

States, found themselves with declining textile industries. Textile production does not require highly skilled

Access for free at openstax.org

21.1 • Protectionism: An Indirect Subsidy from Consumers to Producers 503

workers, so producers were able to set up lower-cost factories in developing countries. In order to “manage”

this loss of jobs and income, the developed countries established an international Multifiber Agreement that

essentially divided the market for textile exports between importers and the remaining domestic producers.

The agreement, which ran from 1974 to 2004, specified the exact quota of textile imports that each developed

country would accept from each low-income country. A similar story exists for sugar imports into the United

States, which are still governed by quotas.

Nontariff barriers are all the other ways that a nation can draw up rules, regulations, inspections, and

paperwork to make it more costly or difficult to import products. A rule requiring certain safety standards can

limit imports just as effectively as high tariffs or low import quotas, for instance. There are also nontariff

barriers in the form of “rules-of-origin” regulations; these rules describe the “Made in Country X” label as the

one in which the last substantial change in the product took place. A manufacturer wishing to evade import

restrictions may try to change the production process so that the last big change in the product happens in

their own country. For example, certain textiles are made in the United States, shipped to other countries,

combined with textiles made in those other countries to make apparel—and then re-exported back to the

United States for a final assembly, to escape paying tariffs or to obtain a “Made in the USA” label.

Despite import quotas, tariffs, and nontariff barriers, the share of apparel sold in the United States that is
imported rose from about half in 1999 to about three-quarters today. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor

Statistics (BLS), estimated the number of U.S. jobs in textiles and apparel fell 44% from 2007 to 2014, and will

fall by another 25% by 2024. Even more U.S. textile industry jobs would have been lost without tariffs.

However, domestic jobs that are saved by import quotas come at a cost. Because textile and apparel

protectionism adds to the costs of imports, consumers end up paying billions of dollars more for clothing each

year.

When the United States eliminates trade barriers in one area, consumers spend the money they save on that

product elsewhere in the economy. Thus, while eliminating trade barriers in one sector of the economy will

likely result in some job loss in that sector, consumers will spend the resulting savings in other sectors of the

economy and hence increase the number of jobs in those other sectors. Of course, workers in some of the

poorest countries of the world who would otherwise have jobs producing textiles, would gain considerably if

the United States reduced its barriers to trade in textiles. That said, there are good reasons to be wary about

reducing barriers to trade. The 2012 and 2013 Bangladeshi fires in textile factories, which resulted in a

horrific loss of life, present complications that our simplified analysis in the chapter will not capture.

Realizing the compromises between nations that come about due to trade policy, many countries came

together in 1947 to form the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). (We’ll cover the GATT in more

detail later in the chapter.) This agreement has since been superseded by the World Trade Organization

(WTO), whose membership includes about 150 nations and most of the world's economies. It is the primary

international mechanism through which nations negotiate their trade rules—including rules about tariffs,

quotas, and nontariff barriers. The next section examines the results of such protectionism and develops a

simple model to show the impact of trade policy.

Demand and Supply Analysis of Protectionism

To the non-economist, restricting imports may appear to be nothing more than taking sales from foreign

producers and giving them to domestic producers. Other factors are at work, however, because firms do not

operate in a vacuum. Instead, firms sell their products either to consumers or to other firms (if they are

business suppliers), who are also affected by the trade barriers. A demand and supply analysis of

protectionism shows that it is not just a matter of domestic gains and foreign losses, but a policy that imposes

substantial domestic costs as well.

Consider two countries, Brazil and the United States, who produce sugar. Each country has a domestic supply

and demand for sugar, as Table 21.1 details and Figure 21.2 illustrates. In Brazil, without trade, the

504 21 • Globalization and Protectionism

equilibrium price of sugar is 12 cents per pound and the equilibrium output is 30 tons. When there is no trade

in the United States, the equilibrium price of sugar is 24 cents per pound and the equilibrium quantity is 80

tons. We label these equilibrium points as point E in each part of the figure.

FIGURE 21.2 The Sugar Trade between Brazil and the United States Before trade, the equilibrium price of sugar in

Brazil is 12 cents a pound and it is 24 cents per pound in the United States. When trade is allowed, businesses will

buy cheap sugar in Brazil and sell it in the United States. This will result in higher prices in Brazil and lower prices in

the United States. Ignoring transaction costs, prices should converge to 16 cents per pound, with Brazil exporting 15

tons of sugar and the United States importing 15 tons of sugar. If trade is only partly open between the countries, it

will lead to an outcome between the free-trade and no-trade possibilities.

21.1 • Protectionism: An Indirect Subsidy from Consumers to Producers 505

If international trade between Brazil and the United States now becomes possible, profit-seeking firms will

spot an opportunity: buy sugar cheaply in Brazil, and sell it at a higher price in the United States. As sugar is

shipped from Brazil to the United States, the quantity of sugar produced in Brazil will be greater than Brazilian

consumption (with the extra production exported), and the amount produced in the United States will be less

than the amount of U.S. consumption (with the extra consumption imported). Exports to the United States will

reduce the sugar supply in Brazil, raising its price. Imports into the United States will increase the sugar

supply, lowering its price. When the sugar price is the same in both countries, there is no incentive to trade

further. As Figure 21.2 shows, the equilibrium with trade occurs at a price of 16 cents per pound. At that price,

the sugar farmers of Brazil supply a quantity of 40 tons, while the consumers of Brazil buy only 25 tons.

The extra 15 tons of sugar production, shown by the horizontal gap between the demand curve and the supply

curve in Brazil, is exported to the United States. In the United States, at a price of 16 cents, the farmers produce

a quantity of 72 tons and consumers demand a quantity of 87 tons. The excess demand of 15 tons by American

consumers, shown by the horizontal gap between demand and domestic supply at the price of 16 cents, is

supplied by imported sugar. Free trade typically results in income distribution effects, but the key is to

recognize the overall gains from trade, as Figure 21.3 shows. Building on the concepts that we outlined in

Demand and Supply and Demand, Supply, and Efficiency in terms of consumer and producer surplus, Figure

21.3 (a) shows that producers in Brazil gain by selling more sugar at a higher price, while Figure 21.3 (b) shows

consumers in the United States benefit from the lower price and greater availability of sugar. Consumers in

Brazil are worse off (compare their no-trade consumer surplus with the free-trade consumer surplus) and U.S.

producers of sugar are worse off. There are gains from trade—an increase in social surplus in each country.

That is, both the United States and Brazil are better off than they would be without trade. The following Clear It

Up feature explains how trade policy can influence low-income countries.

FIGURE 21.3 Free Trade of Sugar Free trade results in gains from trade. Total surplus increases in both countries,

as the two blue-shaded areas show. However, there are clear income distribution effects. Producers gain in the
exporting country, while consumers lose; and in the importing country, consumers gain and producers lose.

Why are there low-income countries?
Why are the poor countries of the world poor? There are a number of reasons, but one of them will surprise you: the

trade policies of the high-income countries. Following is a stark review of social priorities which the international aid

organization, Oxfam International has widely publicized.

High-income countries of the world—primarily the United States, countries of the European Union, and

Japan—subsidize their domestic farmers collectively by about $200 billion per year. Why does this matter?

It matters because the support of farmers in high-income countries is devastating to the livelihoods of farmers in

low-income countries. Even when their climate and land are well-suited to products like cotton, rice, sugar, or milk,

farmers in low-income countries find it difficult to compete. Farm subsidies in the high-income countries cause

farmers in those countries to increase the amount they produce. This increase in supply drives down world prices of

farm products below the costs of production. As Michael Gerson of the Washington Postdescribes it: “[T]he effects

in the cotton-growing regions of West Africa are dramatic . . . keep[ing] millions of Africans on the edge of

malnutrition. In some of the poorest countries on Earth, cotton farmers are some of the poorest people, earning

about a dollar a day. . . . Who benefits from the current system of subsidies? About 20,000 American cotton

producers, with an average annual income of more than $125,000.”

As if subsidies were not enough, often, the high-income countries block agricultural exports from low-income

countries. In some cases, the situation gets even worse when the governments of high-income countries, having

bought and paid for an excess supply of farm products, give away those products in poor countries and drive local

farmers out of business altogether.

For example, shipments of excess milk from the European Union to Jamaica have caused great hardship for

Jamaican dairy farmers. Shipments of excess rice from the United States to Haiti drove thousands of low-income

rice farmers in Haiti out of business. The opportunity costs of protectionism are not paid just by domestic

consumers, but also by foreign producers—and for many agricultural products, those foreign producers are the

world’s poor.

Now, let’s look at what happens with protectionism. U.S. sugar farmers are likely to argue that, if only they

could be protected from sugar imported from Brazil, the United States would have higher domestic sugar

production, more jobs in the sugar industry, and American sugar farmers would receive a higher price. If the

United States government sets a high-enough tariff on imported sugar, or sets an import quota at zero, the

result will be that the quantity of sugar traded between countries could be reduced to zero, and the prices in

each country will return to the levels before trade was allowed.

Blocking only some trade is also possible. Suppose that the United States passed a sugar import quota of seven

tons. The United States will import no more than seven tons of sugar, which means that Brazil can export no

more than seven tons of sugar to the United States. As a result, the price of sugar in the United States will be 20

cents, which is the price where the quantity demanded is seven tons greater than the domestic quantity

supplied. Conversely, if Brazil can export only seven tons of sugar, then the price of sugar in Brazil will be 14

cents per pound, which is the price where the domestic quantity supplied in Brazil is seven tons greater than

domestic demand.

In general, when a country sets a low or medium tariff or import quota, the equilibrium price and quantity will

be somewhere between those that prevail with no trade and those with completely free trade. The following

Work It Out explores the impact of these trade barriers.

WORK IT OUT

Effects of Trade Barriers
Let’s look carefully at the effects of tariffs or quotas. If the U.S. government imposes a tariff or quota sufficient to

eliminate trade with Brazil, two things occur: U.S. consumers pay a higher price and therefore buy a smaller

quantity of sugar. U.S. producers obtain a higher price and they sell a larger quantity of sugar. We can measure

the effects of a tariff on producers and consumers in the United States using two concepts that we developed in

Demand, Supply, and Efficiency: consumer surplus and producer surplus.

FIGURE 21.4 U.S. Sugar Supply and Demand When there is free trade, the equilibrium is at point A. When there

is no trade, the equilibrium is at point E.

Step 1. Look at Figure 21.4, which shows a hypothetical version of the demand and supply of sugar in the United

States.

Step 2. Note that when there is free trade the sugar market is in equilibrium at point A where Domestic Quantity
Demanded (Qd) = Quantity Supplied (Domestic Qs + Imports from Brazil) at a price of PTrade.

Step 3. Note, also, that imports are equal to the distance between points C and A.

Step 4. Recall that consumer surplus is the value that consumers get beyond what they paid for when they buy a

product. Graphically, it is the area under a demand curve but above the price. In this case, the consumer surplus
in the United States is the area of the triangle formed by the points PTrade, A, and B.

Step 5. Recall, also, that producer surplus is another name for profit—it is the income producers get above the
cost of production, which is shown by the supply curve here. In this case, the producer surplus with trade is the
area of the triangle formed by the points Ptrade, C, and D.

Step 6. Suppose that the barriers to trade are imposed, imports are excluded, and the price rises to PNoTrade. Look
what happens to producer surplus and consumer surplus. At the higher price, the domestic quantity supplied

increases from Qs to Q at point E. Because producers are selling more quantity at a higher price, the producer
surplus increases to the area of the triangle PNoTrade, E, and D.

Step 7. Compare the areas of the two triangles and you will see the increase in the producer surplus.

Step 8. Examine the consumer surplus. Consumers are now paying a higher price to get a lower quantity (Q
instead of Qd). Their consumer surplus shrinks to the area of the triangle PNoTrade, E, and B.

Step 9. Determine the net effect. The producer surplus increases by the area Ptrade, C, E, PNoTrade. The loss of
consumer surplus, however, is larger. It is the area Ptrade, A, E, PNoTrade. In other words, consumers lose more

508 21 • Globalization and Protectionism

than producers gain as a result of the trade barriers and the United States has a lower social surplus.

Who Benefits and Who Pays?

Using the demand and supply model, consider the impact of protectionism on producers and consumers in

each of the two countries. For protected producers like U.S. sugar farmers, restricting imports is clearly

positive. Without a need to face imported products, these producers are able to sell more, at a higher price. For

consumers in the country with the protected good, in this case U.S. sugar consumers, restricting imports is

clearly negative. They end up buying a lower quantity of the good and paying a higher price for what they do

buy, compared to the equilibrium price and quantity with trade. The following Clear It Up feature considers

why a country might outsource jobs even for a domestic product.

CLEAR IT UP

Why are Life Savers, an American product, not made in America?
In 1912, Clarence Crane invented Life Savers, the hard candy with the hole in the middle, in Cleveland, Ohio.

Starting in the late 1960s and for 35 years afterward, a plant in Holland, Michigan produced 46 billion Life Savers a

year, in 200 million rolls. However, in 2002, the Kraft Company announced that it would close the Michigan plant

and move Life Saver production across the border to Montreal, Canada.

One reason is that Canadian workers are paid slightly less, especially in healthcare and insurance costs that are not

linked to employment there. Another main reason is that the United States government keeps the sugar price high

for the benefit of sugar farmers, with a combination of a government price floor program and strict quotas on

imported sugar. In recent years, the price of U.S. sugar has been about double the price of sugar produced by the

rest of the world. Life Saver production uses over 100 tons of sugar each day, because the candies are 95% sugar.

A number of other candy companies have also reduced U.S. production and expanded foreign production. Sugar-

using industries have eliminated over 100,000 jobs over the last 20 years, more than seven times the total

employment in sugar production. While the candy industry is especially affected by the cost of sugar, the costs are

spread more broadly. U.S. consumers pay roughly $1 billion per year in higher food prices because of elevated sugar

costs. Meanwhile, sugar producers in low-income countries are driven out of business. Because of the sugar

subsidies to domestic producers and the quotas on imports, they cannot sell their output profitably, or at all, in the

United States market.

The fact that protectionism pushes up prices for consumers in the country enacting such protectionism is not
always acknowledged openly, but it is not disputed. After all, if protectionism did not benefit domestic

producers, there would not be much point in enacting such policies in the first place. Protectionism is simply a

method of requiring consumers to subsidize producers. The subsidy is indirect, since consumers pay for it

through higher prices, rather than a direct government subsidy paid with money collected from taxpayers.

However, protectionism works like a subsidy, nonetheless. The American satirist Ambrose Bierce defined

“tariff” this way in his 1911 book, The Devil’s Dictionary: “Tariff, n. A scale of taxes on imports, designed to

protect the domestic producer against the greed of his consumer.”

The effect of protectionism on producers and consumers in the foreign country is complex. When a

government uses an import quota to impose partial protectionism, Brazilian sugar producers receive a lower

price for the sugar they sell in Brazil—but a higher price for the sugar they are allowed to export to the United

States. Notice that some of the burden of protectionism, paid by domestic consumers, ends up in the hands of

foreign producers in this case. Brazilian sugar consumers seem to benefit from U.S. protectionism, because it

reduces the price of sugar that they pay (compared to the free-trade situation). On the other hand, at least

some of these Brazilian sugar consumers also work as sugar farmers, so protectionism reduces their incomes

and jobs. Moreover, if trade between the countries vanishes, Brazilian consumers would miss out on better

prices for imported goods—which do not appear in our single-market example of sugar protectionism.

The effects of protectionism on foreign countries notwithstanding, protectionism requires domestic

consumers of a product (consumers may include either households or other firms) to pay higher prices to

benefit domestic producers of that product. In addition, when a country enacts protectionism, it loses the

economic gains it would have been able to achieve through a combination of comparative advantage,

specialized learning, and economies of scale, concepts that we discuss in International Trade.

21.2 International Trade and Its Effects on Jobs, Wages, and Working
Conditions

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Discuss how international trade influences the job market

• Analyze the opportunity cost of protectionism

• Explain how international trade impacts wages, labor standards, and working conditions

In theory at least, imports might injure workers in several different ways: fewer jobs, lower wages, or poor
working conditions. Let’s consider these in turn.

Fewer Jobs?

In the early 1990s, the United States was negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)1
with Mexico, an agreement that reduced tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers to trade between the

United States, Mexico, and Canada. H. Ross Perot, a 1992 candidate for U.S. president, claimed, in prominent

campaign arguments, that if the United States expanded trade with Mexico, there would be a “giant sucking

sound” as U.S. employers relocated to Mexico to take advantage of lower wages. After all, average wages in

Mexico were, at that time, about one-eighth of those in the United States. NAFTA passed Congress, President

Bill Clinton signed it into law, and it took effect in 1995. For the next six years, the United States economy had

some of the most rapid job growth and low unemployment in its history. Those who feared that open trade with

Mexico would lead to a dramatic decrease in jobs were proven wrong.

This result was no surprise to economists. After all, the trend toward globalization has been going on for

decades, not just since NAFTA. If trade reduced the number of available jobs, then the United States should

have been seeing a steady loss of jobs for decades. While the United States economy does experience rises and

falls in unemployment rates, the number of jobs is not falling over extended periods of time. The number of

U.S. jobs rose from 71 million in 1970 to 150 million in 2021.

Protectionism certainly saves jobs in the specific industry being protected but, for two reasons, it costs jobs in

other unprotected industries. First, if consumers are paying higher prices to the protected industry, they

inevitably have less money to spend on goods from other industries, and so jobs are lost in those other

industries. Second, if a firm sells the protected product to other firms, so that other firms must now pay a

higher price for a key input, then those firms will lose sales to foreign producers who do not need to pay the

higher price. Lost sales translate into lost jobs. The hidden opportunity cost of using protectionism to save jobs

in one industry is jobs sacrificed in other industries. This is why the United States International Trade

Commission, in its study of barriers to trade, predicts that reducing trade barriers would not lead to an overall

loss of jobs. Protectionism reshuffles jobs from industries without import protections to industries that are

protected from imports, but it does not create more jobs.

Moreover, the costs of saving jobs through protectionism can be very high. A number of different studies have

attempted to estimate the cost to consumers in higher prices per job saved through protectionism. Table 21.2

shows a sample of results, compiled by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Saving a job through

1 As of July 1, 2020, NAFTA was officially replaced with the United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) free trade agreement. It is
broadly similar to the original NAFTA.

510 21 • Globalization and Protectionism

protectionism typically costs much more than the actual worker’s salary. For example, a study published in

2002 compiled evidence that using protectionism to save an average job in the textile and apparel industry

would cost $199,000 per job saved. In other words, those workers could have been paid $100,000 per year to

be unemployed and the cost would only be half of what it is to keep them working in the textile and apparel

industry. This result is not unique to textiles and apparel.

TABLE 21.2 Cost to U.S. Consumers of Saving a Job through Protectionism

(Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas)

Why does it cost so much to save jobs through protectionism? The basic reason is that not all of the extra

money that consumers pay because of tariffs or quotas goes to save jobs. For example, if the government

imposes tariffs on steel imports so that steel buyers pay a higher price, U.S. steel companies earn greater

profits, buy more equipment, pay bigger bonuses to managers, give pay raises to existing employees—and also

avoid firing some additional workers. Only part of the higher price of protected steel goes toward saving jobs.

Also, when an industry is protected, the economy as a whole loses the benefits of playing to its comparative

advantage—in other words, producing what it is best at. Therefore, part of the higher price that consumers pay

for protected goods is lost economic efficiency, which we can measure as another deadweight loss, like what

we discussed in Labor and Financial Markets.

There’s a bumper sticker that speaks to the threat some U.S. workers feel from imported products: “Buy

American—Save U.S. Jobs.” If an economist were driving the car, the sticker might declare: “Block

Imports—Save Jobs for Some Americans, Lose Jobs for Other Americans, and Also Pay High Prices.”

Trade and Wages

Even if trade does not reduce the number of jobs, it could affect wages. Here, it is important to separate issues

about the average level of wages from issues about whether the wages of certain workers may be helped or hurt

by trade.

Because trade raises the amount that an economy can produce by letting firms and workers play to their

comparative advantage, trade will also cause the average level of wages in an economy to rise. Workers who

21.2 • International Trade and Its Effects on Jobs, Wages, and Working Conditions 511

can produce more will be more desirable to employers, which will shift the demand for their labor out to the

right, and increase wages in the labor market. By contrast, barriers to trade will reduce the average level of

wages in an economy.

However, even if trade increases the overall wage level, it will still benefit some workers and hurt others.

Workers in industries that are confronted by competition from imported products may find that demand for

their labor decreases and shifts back to the left, so that their wages decline with a rise in international trade.

Conversely, workers in industries that benefit from selling in global markets may find that demand for their

labor shifts out to the right, so that trade raises their wages.

coffee.

One concern is that while globalization may be benefiting high-skilled, high-wage workers in the United States,

it may also impose costs on low-skilled, low-wage workers. After all, high-skilled U.S. workers presumably

benefit from increased sales of sophisticated products like computers, machinery, and pharmaceuticals in

which the United States has a comparative advantage. Meanwhile, low-skilled U.S. workers must now compete

against extremely low-wage workers worldwide for making simpler products like toys and clothing. As a result,

the wages of low-skilled U.S. workers are likely to fall. There are, however, a number of reasons to believe that

while globalization has helped some U.S. industries and hurt others, it has not focused its negative impact on

the wages of low-skilled Americans. First, about half of U.S. trade is intra-industry trade. That means the U.S.

trades similar goods with other high-wage economies like Canada, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

For instance, in 2014 the U.S. exported over 2 million cars, from all the major automakers, and also imported

several million cars from other countries.

Most U.S. workers in these industries have above-average skills and wages—and many of them do quite well in

the world of globalization. Some evidence suggested that intra-industry trade between similar countries had a

small impact on domestic workers but later evidence indicates that it all depends on how flexible the labor

market is. In other words, the key is how flexible workers are in finding jobs in different industries. The effect

of trade on low-wage workers depends considerably on the structure of labor markets and indirect effects felt

in other parts of the economy. For example, in the United States and the United Kingdom, because labor

market frictions are low, the impact of trade on low income workers is small.

Second, many low-skilled U.S. workers hold service jobs that imports from low-wage countries cannot replace.

For example, we cannot import lawn care services or moving and hauling services or hotel maids from

countries long distances away like China or Bangladesh. Competition from imported products is not the

primary determinant of their wages.

Finally, while the focus of the discussion here is on wages, it is worth pointing out that low-wage U.S. workers

suffer due to protectionism in all the industries—even those in which they do not work. For example, food and

clothing are protected industries. These low-wage workers therefore pay higher prices for these basic

necessities and as such their dollar stretches over fewer goods.

The benefits and costs of increased trade in terms of its effect on wages are not distributed evenly across the

economy. However, the growth of international trade has helped to raise the productivity of U.S. workers as a

whole—and thus helped to raise the average level of wages.

Labor Standards and Working Conditions

Workers in many low-income countries around the world labor under conditions that would be illegal for a

worker in the United States. Workers in countries like China, Thailand, Brazil, South Africa, and Poland are

often paid less than the United States minimum wage. For example, in the United States, the national

512 21 • Globalization and Protectionism

minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. A typical wage in many low-income countries might be more like $7.25 per

day, or often much less. Moreover, working conditions in low-income countries may be extremely unpleasant,

or even unsafe. In the worst cases, production may involve the child labor or even workers who are mistreated,

abused, or entrapped in their jobs. These concerns over foreign labor standards do not affect most of U.S.

trade, which is intra-industry and carried out with other high-income countries that have labor standards

similar to the United States, but it is, nonetheless, morally and economically important.

In thinking about labor standards in other countries, it is important to draw some distinctions between what is

truly unacceptable and what is painful to think about. Most people, economists included, have little difficulty

with the idea that production by six-year-olds confined in factories, by people who are abused or mistreated, or

by slave labor is morally unacceptable. They would support aggressive efforts to eliminate such

practices—including shutting out imported products made with such labor. Many cases, however, are less

clear-cut. An opinion article in the New York Timesseveral years ago described the case of Ahmed Zia, a

14-year-old boy from Pakistan. He earned $2 per day working in a carpet factory. He dropped out of school in

second grade. Should the United States and other countries refuse to purchase rugs made by Ahmed and his

co-workers? If the carpet factories were to close, the likely alternative job for Ahmed is farm work, and as

Ahmed says of his carpet-weaving job: “This makes much more money and is more comfortable.”

Other workers may have even less attractive alternative jobs, perhaps scavenging garbage or prostitution. The

real problem for Ahmed and many others in low-income countries is not that globalization has made their

lives worse, but rather that they have so few good life alternatives. The United States went through similar

situations during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

In closing, there is some irony when the United States government or U.S. citizens take issue with labor

standards in low-income countries, because the United States is not a world leader in government laws to

protect employees. According to a recent study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and

Development (OECD), the U.S. is the only one of 41 countries that does not provide mandated paid leave for

new parents, and among the 40 countries that do mandate paid leave, the minimum duration is about two

months. Many European workers receive six weeks or more of paid vacation per year. In the United States,

vacations are often one to three weeks per year. If European countries accused the United States of using

unfair labor standards to make U.S. products cheaply, and announced that they would shut out all U.S. imports

until the United States adopted paid parental leave, added more national holidays, and doubled vacation time,

Americans would be outraged. Yet when U.S. protectionists start talking about restricting imports from poor

countries because of low wage levels and poor working conditions, they are making a very similar argument.

This is not to say that labor conditions in low-income countries are not an important issue. They are. However,

linking labor conditions in low-income countries to trade deflects the emphasis from the real question to ask:

“What are acceptable and enforceable minimum labor standards and protections to have the world over?”

21.3 Arguments in Support of Restricting Imports

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Explain and analyze various arguments that are in support of restricting imports, including the infant

industry argument, the anti-dumping argument, the environmental protection argument, the unsafe

consumer products argument, and the national interest argument

• Explain dumping and race to the bottom

• Evaluate the significance of countries’ perceptions on the benefits of growing trade

As we previously noted, protectionism requires domestic consumers of a product to pay higher prices to

benefit domestic producers of that product. Countries that institute protectionist policies lose the economic

gains achieved through a combination of comparative advantage, specialized learning, and economies of scale.

With these overall costs in mind, let us now consider, one by one, a number of arguments that support

restricting imports.

21.3 • Arguments in Support of Restricting Imports 513

The Infant Industry Argument

Imagine Bhutan wants to start its own computer industry, but it has no computer firms that can produce at a

low enough price and high enough quality to compete in world markets. However, Bhutanese politicians,

business leaders, and workers hope that if the local industry had a chance to get established, before it needed

to face international competition, then a domestic company or group of companies could develop the skills,

management, technology, and economies of scale that it needs to become a successful profit-earning domestic

industry. Thus, the infant industry argument for protectionism is to block imports for a limited time, to give

the infant industry time to mature, before it starts competing on equal terms in the global economy. (Revisit

Macroeconomic Policy Around the World for more information on the infant industry argument.)

The infant industry argument is theoretically possible, even sensible: give an industry a short-term indirect

subsidy through protection, and then reap the long-term economic benefits of having a vibrant, healthy

industry. Implementation, however, is tricky. In many countries, infant industries have gone from babyhood to

senility and obsolescence without ever having reached the profitable maturity stage. Meanwhile, the

protectionism that was supposed to be short-term often took a very long time to be repealed.

As one example, Brazil treated its computer industry as an infant industry from the late 1970s until about

1990. In an attempt to establish its computer industry in the global economy, Brazil largely barred imports of

computer products for several decades. This policy guaranteed increased sales for Brazilian computers.

However, by the mid-1980s, due to lack of international competition, Brazil had a backward and out-of-date

industry, typically lagging behind world standards for price and performance by three to five years—a long

time in this fast-moving industry. After more than a decade, during which Brazilian consumers and industries

that would have benefited from up-to-date computers paid the costs and Brazil’s computer industry never

competed effectively on world markets, Brazil phased out its infant industry policy for the computer industry.

Protectionism for infant industries always imposes costs on domestic users of the product, and typically has

provided little benefit in the form of stronger, competitive industries. However, several countries in East Asia

offer an exception. Japan, Korea, Thailand, and other countries in this region have sometimes provided a

package of indirect and direct subsidies targeted at certain industries, including protection from foreign

competition and government loans at interest rates below the market equilibrium. In Japan and Korea, for

example, subsidies helped get their domestic steel and auto industries up and running.

Why did the infant industry policy of protectionism and other subsidies work fairly well in East Asia? An early

1990 World Bank study offered three guidelines to countries thinking about infant industry protection:

1. Do not hand out protectionism and other subsidies to all industries, but focus on a few industries where

your country has a realistic chance to be a world-class producer.

2. Be very hesitant about using protectionism in areas like computers, where many other industries rely on

having the best products available, because it is not useful to help one industry by imposing high costs on

many other industries.

3. Have clear guidelines for when the infant industry policy will end.

In Korea in the 1970s and 1980s, a common practice was to link protectionism and subsidies to export sales in

global markets. If export sales rose, then the infant industry had succeeded and the government could phase

out protectionism. If export sales did not rise, then the infant industry policy had failed and the government

could phase out protectionism. Either way, the protectionism would be temporary.

Following these rules is easier said than done. Politics often intrudes, both in choosing which industries will

receive the benefits of treatment as “infants” and when to phase out import restrictions and other subsidies.

Also, if the country's government wishes to impose costs on its citizens so that it can provide subsidies to a few

key industries, it has many tools for doing such as direct government payments, loans, targeted tax reductions,

and government support of research and development of new technologies. In other words, protectionism is

not the only or even the best way to support key industries.

The Anti-Dumping Argument

Dumping refers to selling goods below their cost of production. Anti-dumping laws block imports that are

sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their

cost of production. Since dumping is not allowed under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, nations that

believe they are on the receiving end of dumped goods can file a complaint with the WTO. According to the

WTO, between 1995 and 2020, it oversaw 137 anti-dumping disputes. Note that dumping cases are

countercyclical. During recessions, case filings increase. During economic booms, case filings go down.

Individual countries have also frequently started their own anti-dumping investigations. The U.S. government

has dozens of anti-dumping orders in place from past investigations. In 2022, for example, some U.S. imports

that were under anti-dumping orders included olives from Spain, steel from South Korea, coated paper from

Indonesia, light commercial vehicles from Germany and Italy, fish fillets from Vietnam, and cellulose pulp

Why Might Dumping Occur?

Why would foreign firms export a product at less than its cost of production—which presumably means taking

a loss? This question has two possible answers, one innocent and one more sinister.

The innocent explanation is that demand and supply set market prices, not the cost of production. Perhaps

demand for a product shifts back to the left or supply shifts out to the right, which drives the market price to

low levels—even below the cost of production. When a local store has a going-out-of-business sale, for example,

it may sell goods at below the cost of production. If international companies find that there is excess supply of

steel or computer chips or machine tools that is driving the market price down below their cost of

production—this may be the market in action.

The sinister explanation is that dumping is part of a long-term strategy. Foreign firms sell goods at prices

below the cost of production for a short period of time, and when they have driven out the domestic U.S.

competition, they then raise prices. Economists sometimes call this scenario predatory pricing, which we

discuss in the Monopoly (http://openstax.org/books/principles-economics-3e/pages/9-introduction-to-a-

monopoly) chapter.

Should Anti-Dumping Cases Be Limited?

Anti-dumping cases pose two questions. How much sense do they make in economic theory? How much sense

do they make as practical policy?

In terms of economic theory, the case for anti-dumping laws is weak. In a market governed by demand and

supply, the government does not guarantee that firms will be able to make a profit. After all, low prices are

difficult for producers, but benefit consumers. Moreover, although there are plenty of cases in which foreign

producers have driven out domestic firms, there are zero documented cases in which the foreign producers

then jacked up prices. Instead, foreign producers typically continue competing hard against each other and

providing low prices to consumers. In short, it is difficult to find evidence of predatory pricing by foreign firms

exporting to the United States.

Even if one could make a case that the government should sometimes enact anti-dumping rules in the short

term, and then allow free trade to resume shortly thereafter, there is a growing concern that anti-dumping

investigations often involve more politics than careful analysis. The U.S. Commerce Department is charged

with calculating the appropriate “cost of production,” which can be as much an art as a science.

For example, if a company built a new factory two years ago, should it count part of the factory’s cost in this

year’s cost of production? When a company is in a country where the government controls prices, like China

for example, how can one measure the true cost of production? When a domestic industry complains loudly

enough, government regulators seem very likely to find that unfair dumping has occurred. A common pattern

has arisen where a domestic industry files an anti-dumping complaint, the governments meet and negotiate a

reduction in imports, and then the domestic producers drop the anti-dumping suit. In such cases, anti-

dumping cases often appear to be little more than a cover story for imposing tariffs or import quotas.

In the 1980s, the United States, Canada, the European Union, Australia, and New Zealand implemented almost

all the anti-dumping cases. By the 2000s, countries like Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, South Africa, Mexico,

and India were filing the majority of the anti-dumping cases before the WTO. As the number of anti-dumping

cases has increased, and as countries such as the United States and the European Union feel targeted by the

anti-dumping actions of others, the WTO may well propose some additional guidelines to limit the reach of

anti-dumping laws.

The Environmental Protection Argument

The potential for global trade to affect the environment has become controversial. A president of the Sierra

Club, an environmental lobbying organization, once wrote: “The consequences of globalization for the

environment are not good. … Globalization, if we are lucky, will raise average incomes enough to pay for

cleaning up some of the mess that we have made. But before we get there, globalization could also destroy

enough of the planet’s basic biological and physical systems that prospects for life itself will be radically

compromised.”

If free trade meant the destruction of life itself, then even economists would convert to protectionism! While

globalization—and economic activity of all kinds—can pose environmental dangers, it seems quite possible

that, with the appropriate safeguards in place, we can minimize the environmental impacts of trade. In some

cases, trade may even bring environmental benefits.

In general, high-income countries such as the United States, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the

nations of the European Union have relatively strict environmental standards. In contrast, middle- and low-

income countries like Brazil, Nigeria, India, and China have lower environmental standards. The general view

of the governments of such countries is that environmental protection is a luxury: as soon as their people have

enough to eat, decent healthcare, and longer life expectancies, then they will spend more money on items such

as sewage treatment plants, scrubbers to reduce air pollution from factory smokestacks, and national parks to

protect wildlife.

This gap in environmental standards between high-income and low-income countries raises two worrisome

possibilities in a world of increasing global trade: the “race to the bottom” scenario and the question of how

quickly environmental standards will improve in low-income countries.

The Race to the Bottom Scenario

The race to the bottom scenario of global environmental degradation runs like this. Profit-seeking

multinational companies shift their production from countries with strong environmental standards to

countries with weak standards, thus reducing their costs and increasing their profits. Faced with such

behavior, countries reduce their environmental standards to attract multinational firms, which, after all,

provide jobs and economic clout. As a result, global production becomes concentrated in countries where

firms can pollute the most and environmental laws everywhere “race to the bottom.”

Although the race-to-the-bottom scenario sounds plausible, it does not appear to describe reality. In fact, the

financial incentive for firms to shift production to poor countries to take advantage of their weaker

environmental rules does not seem especially powerful. When firms decide where to locate a new factory, they

look at many different factors: the costs of labor and financial capital; whether the location is close to a reliable

516 21 • Globalization and Protectionism

suppliers of the inputs that they need; whether the location is close to customers; the quality of transportation,

communications, and electrical power networks; the level of taxes; and the competence and honesty of the

local government. The cost of environmental regulations is a factor, too, but typically environmental costs are

no more than 1 to 2% of the costs that a large industrial plant faces. The other factors that determine location

are much more important to these companies than trying to skimp on environmental protection costs.

When an international company does choose to build a plant in a low-income country with lax environmental

laws, it typically builds a plant similar to those that it operates in high-income countries with stricter

environmental standards. Part of the reason for this decision is that designing an industrial plant is a complex

and costly task, and so if a plant works well in a high-income country, companies prefer to use the same design

everywhere. Also, companies realize that if they create an environmental disaster in a low-income country, it is

likely to cost them a substantial amount of money in paying for damages, lost trust, and reduced sales—by

building up-to-date plants everywhere they minimize such risks. As a result of these factors, foreign-owned

plants in low-income countries often have a better record of compliance with environmental laws than do

locally-owned plants.

Pressuring Low-Income Countries for Higher Environmental Standards

In some cases, the issue is not so much whether globalization will pressure low-income countries to reduce

their environmental standards, but instead whether the threat of blocking international trade can pressure

these countries into adopting stronger standards. For example, restrictions on ivory imports in high-income

countries, along with stronger government efforts to catch elephant poachers, have been credited with helping

to reduce the illegal poaching of elephants in certain African countries.

However, it would be highly undemocratic for the well-fed citizens of high-income countries to attempt to

dictate to the ill-fed citizens of low-income countries what domestic policies and priorities they must adopt, or

how they should balance environmental goals against other priorities for their citizens. Furthermore, if high-

income countries want stronger environmental standards in low-income countries, they have many options

other than the threat of protectionism. For example, high-income countries could pay for anti-pollution

equipment in low-income countries, or could help to pay for national parks. High-income countries could help

pay for and carry out the scientific and economic studies that would help environmentalists in low-income

countries to make a more persuasive case for the economic benefits of protecting the environment.

After all, environmental protection is vital to two industries of key importance in many low-income

countries—agriculture and tourism. Environmental advocates can set up standards for labeling products, like

“this tuna caught in a net that kept dolphins safe” or “this product made only with wood not taken from

rainforests,” so that consumer pressure can reinforce environmentalist values. The United Nations also

reinforces these values, by sponsoring treaties to address issues such as climate change and global warming,
the preservation of biodiversity, the spread of deserts, and the environmental health of the seabed. Countries

that share a national border or are within a region often sign environmental agreements about air and water

rights, too. The WTO is also becoming more aware of environmental issues and more careful about ensuring

that increases in trade do not inflict environmental damage.

Finally, note that these concerns about the race to the bottom or pressuring low-income countries for more

strict environmental standards do not apply very well to the roughly half of all U.S. trade that occurs with other

high-income countries. Many European countries have stricter environmental standards in certain industries

than the United States.

The Unsafe Consumer Products Argument

One argument for shutting out certain imported products is that they are unsafe for consumers. Consumer

rights groups have sometimes warned that the World Trade Organization would require nations to reduce their

health and safety standards for imported products. However, the WTO explains its current agreement on the

subject in this way: “It allows countries to set their own standards.” It also says “regulations must be based on

Access for free at openstax.org

21.3 • Arguments in Support of Restricting Imports 517

science. . . . And they should not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate between countries where identical or

similar conditions prevail.” Thus, for example, under WTO rules it is perfectly legitimate for the United States

to pass laws requiring that allfood products or cars sold in the United States meet certain safety standards

approved by the United States government, whether or not other countries choose to pass similar standards.

However, such standards must have some scientific basis. It is improper to impose one set of health and safety

standards for domestically produced goods but a different set of standards for imports, or one set of standards

for imports from Europe and a different set of standards for imports from Latin America.

In 2007, Mattel recalled nearly two million toys imported from China due to concerns about high levels of lead

in the paint, as well as some loose parts. It is unclear if other toys were subject to similar standards. In 2013,

Japan blocked imports of U.S. wheat because of concerns that genetically modified (GMO) wheat might be

included in the shipments. The science on the impact of GMOs on health is still developing.

The National Interest Argument

Some argue that a nation should not depend too heavily on other countries for supplies of certain key products,

such as oil, or for special materials or technologies that might have national security applications. On closer

consideration, this argument for protectionism proves rather weak.

As an example, in the United States, oil provides about 36% of all the energy and 21% of the oil used in the

United States economy is imported. Several times in the last few decades, when disruptions in the Middle East

have shifted the supply curve of oil back to the left and sharply raised the price, the effects have been felt

across the United States economy. This is not, however, a very convincing argument for restricting oil imports.

If the United States needs to be protected from a possible cutoff of foreign oil, then a more reasonable strategy

would be to import 100% of the petroleum supply now, and save U.S. domestic oil resources for when or if the

foreign supply is cut off. It might also be useful to import extra oil and put it into a stockpile for use in an

emergency, as the United States government did by starting a Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 1977. Moreover,

it may be necessary to discourage people from using oil, and to start a high-powered program to seek out

alternatives to oil. A straightforward way to do this would be to raise taxes on oil. Additionally, it makes no

sense to argue that because oil is highly important to the United States economy, then the United States should

shut out oil imports and use up its domestic supplies more quickly. U.S. domestic oil production is increasing.

Shale oil is adding to domestic supply using fracking extraction techniques.

Whether or not to limit certain kinds of imports of key technologies or materials that might be important to

national security and weapons systems is a slightly different issue. If weapons’ builders are not confident that

they can continue to obtain a key product in wartime, they might decide to avoid designing weapons that use

this key product, or they can go ahead and design the weapons and stockpile enough of the key high-tech

components or materials to last through an armed conflict. There is a U.S. Defense National Stockpile Center
that has built up reserves of many materials, from aluminum oxides, antimony, and bauxite to tungsten,

vegetable tannin extracts, and zinc (although many of these stockpiles have been reduced and sold in recent

years). Think every country is pro-trade? How about the U.S.? The following Clear It Up might surprise you.

CLEAR IT UP

How does the United States really feel about expanding trade?
How do people around the world feel about expanding trade between nations? In summer 2007, the Pew

Foundation surveyed 45,000 people in 47 countries. One of the questions asked about opinions on growing trade

ties between countries. Table 21.3 shows the percentages who answered either “very good” or “somewhat good”

for some of countries surveyed.

For those who think of the United States as the world’s leading supporter of expanding trade, the survey results may

be perplexing. When adding up the shares of those who say that growing trade ties between countries is “very good”

518 21 • Globalization and Protectionism

or “somewhat good,” Americans had the least favorable attitude toward increasing globalization, while the Chinese

and South Africans ranked highest. In fact, among the 47 countries surveyed, the United States ranked by far the

lowest on this measure, followed by Egypt, Italy, and Argentina.

One final reason why economists often treat the national interest argument skeptically is that lobbyists and

politicians can tout almost any product as vital to national security. In 1954, the United States became worried

that it was importing half of the wool required for military uniforms, so it declared wool and mohair to be

“strategic materials” and began to give subsidies to wool and mohair farmers. Although the government

removed wool from the official list of “strategic” materials in 1960, the subsidies for mohair continued for

almost 40 years until the government repealed them in 1993, and then reinstated them in 2002. All too often,

the national interest argument has become an excuse for handing out the indirect subsidy of protectionism to

certain industries or companies. After all, politicians, not nonpartisan analysts make decisions about what

constitutes a key strategic material.

21.4 • How Governments Enact Trade Policy: Globally, Regionally, and Nationally 519

The World Trade Organization

The World Trade Organization (WTO) was officially born in 1995, but its history is much longer. In the years

after the Great Depression and World War II, there was a worldwide push to build institutions that would tie the

nations of the world together. The United Nations officially came into existence in 1945. The World Bank,

which assists the poorest people in the world, and the International Monetary Fund, which addresses issues

raised by international financial transactions, were both created in 1946. The third planned organization was

to be an International Trade Organization, which would manage international trade. The United Nations was

unable to agree to this. Instead, 27 nations signed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in

Geneva, Switzerland on October 30, 1947 to provide a forum in which nations could come together to negotiate

reductions in tariffs and other barriers to trade. In 1995, the GATT transformed into the WTO.

The GATT process was to negotiate an agreement to reduce barriers to trade, sign that agreement, pause for a

while, and then start negotiating the next agreement. Table 21.4 shows rounds of talks in the GATT, and now

the WTO. Notice that the early rounds of GATT talks took a relatively short time, included a small number of

countries, and focused almost entirely on reducing tariffs. Since the mid-1960s, however, rounds of trade talks

have taken years, included a large number of countries, and have included an ever-broadening range of issues.

TABLE 21.4 The Negotiating Rounds of GATT and the World Trade Organization

The sluggish pace of GATT negotiations led to an old joke that GATT really stood for Gentleman’s Agreement to

Talk and Talk. The slow pace of international trade talks, however, is understandable, even sensible. Having

dozens of nations agree to any treaty is a lengthy process. GATT often set up separate trading rules for certain

industries, like agriculture, and separate trading rules for certain countries, like the low-income countries.

There were rules, exceptions to rules, opportunities to opt out of rules, and precise wording to be fought over in

every case. Like the GATT before it, the WTO is not a world government, with power to impose its decisions on

others. The total staff of the WTO Secretariat in 2021 is 625 people and its annual budget (as of 2020) is $197

million, which makes it smaller in size than many large universities.

Regional Trading Agreements

There are different types of economic integration across the globe, ranging from free trade agreements, in

which participants allow each other’s imports without tariffs or quotas, to common markets, in which

participants have a common external trade policy as well as free trade within the group, to full economic

unions, in which, in addition to a common market, monetary and fiscal policies are coordinated. Many nations

belong both to the World Trade Organization and to regional trading agreements.

The best known of these regional trading agreements is the European Union. In the years after World War II,

leaders of several European nations reasoned that if they could tie their economies together more closely, they

might be more likely to avoid another devastating war. Their efforts began with a free trade association,

evolved into a common market, and then transformed into what is now a full economic union, known as the

European Union. The EU, as it is often called, has a number of goals. For example, in the early 2000s it

introduced a common currency for Europe, the euro, and phased out most of the former national forms of

money like the German mark and the French franc, though a few have retained their own currency. Another

key element of the union is to eliminate barriers to the mobility of goods, labor, and capital across Europe. In

2016, Britain voted to leave the European Union—a move that was completed in January 2020.

For the United States, perhaps the best-known regional trading agreement is the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA). 2 The United States also participates in some less-prominent regional trading
agreements, like the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which offers reduced tariffs for imports from these countries,

and a free trade agreement with Israel.

The world has seen a flood of regional trading agreements in recent years. About 100 such agreements are now

in place. Table 21.5 lists a few of the more prominent ones. Some are just agreements to continue talking.

Others set specific goals for reducing tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers. One economist described

the current trade treaties as a “spaghetti bowl,” which is what a map with lines connecting all the countries

with trade treaties looks like.

There is concern among economists who favor free trade that some of these regional agreements may promise

free trade, but actually act as a way for the countries within the regional agreement to try to limit trade from

anywhere else. In some cases, the regional trade agreements may even conflict with the broader agreements of

the World Trade Organization.

Trade Policy at the National Level

Yet another dimension of trade policy, along with international and regional trade agreements, happens at the

national level. The United States, for example, imposes import quotas on sugar, because of a fear that such

imports would drive down the price of sugar and thus injure domestic sugar producers. One of the jobs of the

United States Department of Commerce is to determine if there is import dumping from other countries. The

United States International Trade Commission—a government agency—determines whether the dumping has

substantially injured domestic industries, and if so, the president can impose tariffs that are intended to offset

the unfairly low price.

In the arena of trade policy, the battle often seems to be between national laws that increase protectionism and

international agreements that try to reduce protectionism, like the WTO. Why would a country pass laws or

negotiate agreements to shut out certain foreign products, like sugar or textiles, while simultaneously

negotiating to reduce trade barriers in general? One plausible answer is that international trade agreements

offer a method for countries to restrain their own special interests. A member of Congress can say to an

industry lobbying for tariffs or quotas on imports: “Sure would like to help you, but that pesky WTO agreement

just won’t let me.”

LINK IT UP

If consumers are the biggest losers from trade, why do they not fight back? The quick answer is because it is

easier to organize a small group of people around a narrow interest (producers) versus a large group that has

diffuse interests (consumers). This is a question about trade policy theory. Visit this website

(http://openstax.org/l/tradepolicy) and read the article by Jonathan Rauch.

522 21 • Globalization and Protectionism

Long-Term Trends in Barriers to Trade

In newspaper headlines, trade policy appears mostly as disputes and acrimony. Countries are almost

constantly threatening to challenge other nations' “unfair” trading practices. Cases are brought to the dispute

settlement procedures of the WTO, the European Union, NAFTA, and other regional trading agreements.

Politicians in national legislatures, goaded on by lobbyists, often threaten to pass bills that will “establish a fair

playing field” or “prevent unfair trade”—although most such bills seek to accomplish these high-sounding

goals by placing more restrictions on trade. Protesters in the streets may object to specific trade rules or to the

entire practice of international trade.

Through all the controversy, the general trend in the last 60 years is clearly toward lower barriers to trade. The

average level of tariffs on imported products charged by industrialized countries was 40% in 1946. By 1990,

after decades of GATT negotiations, it was down to less than 5%. One of the reasons that GATT negotiations

shifted from focusing on tariff reduction in the early rounds to a broader agenda was that tariffs had been

reduced so dramatically there was not much more to do in that area. U.S. tariffs have followed this general

pattern: After rising sharply during the Great Depression, tariffs dropped off to less than 2% by the end of the

century. Although measures of import quotas and nontariff barriers are less exact than those for tariffs, they
generally appear to be at lower levels than they had been previously, too.

Thus, the last half-century has seen both a dramatic reduction in government-created barriers to trade, such

as tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers, and also a number of technological developments that have

made international trade easier, like advances in transportation, communication, and information

management. The result has been the powerful surge of international trade.

These trends were altered by two important events in 2016: the UK vote to leave the EU and the election of

President Trump in the United States, whose administration pursued a policy of raising trade barriers. In

2018, tariffs on a broad range of imports from China were raised by around 25%. As of 2022, the UK has been

out of the EU for two years, and it remains unclear if President Biden’s administration will adjust or remove

President Trump’s trade barriers.

21.5 The Tradeoffs of Trade Policy

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

• Asses the complexity of international trade

• Discuss why a market-oriented economy is so affected by international trade

• Explain disruptive market change

Economists readily acknowledge that international trade is not all sunshine, roses, and happy endings. Over
time, the average person gains from international trade, both as a worker who has greater productivity and

higher wages because of the benefits of specialization and comparative advantage, and as a consumer who can

benefit from shopping all over the world for a greater variety of quality products at attractive prices. The

“average person,” however, is hypothetical, not real—representing a mix of those who have done very well,

those who have done all right, and those who have done poorly. It is a legitimate concern of public policy to

focus not just on the average or on the success stories, but also on those who have not been so fortunate.

Workers in other countries, the environment, and prospects for new industries and materials that might be of

key importance to the national economy are also all legitimate issues.

The common belief among economists is that it is better to embrace the gains from trade, and then deal with

the costs and tradeoffs with other policy tools, than it is to cut off trade to avoid the costs and tradeoffs.

To gain a better intuitive understanding for this argument, consider a hypothetical American company called

Technotron. Technotron invents a new scientific technology that allows the firm to increase the output and

quality of its goods with a smaller number of workers at a lower cost. As a result of this technology, other U.S.

Access for free at openstax.org

21.5 • The Tradeoffs of Trade Policy 523

firms in this industry will lose money and will also have to lay off workers—and some of the competing firms

will even go bankrupt. Should the United States government protect the existing firms and their employees by

making it illegal for Technotron to use its new technology? Most people who live in market-oriented economies

would oppose trying to block better products that lower the cost of services. Certainly, there is a case for

society providing temporary support and assistance for those who find themselves without work. Many would

argue for government support of programs that encourage retraining and acquiring additional skills.

Government might also support research and development efforts, so that other firms may find ways of

outdoing Technotron. Blocking the new technology altogether, however, seems like a mistake. After all, few

people would advocate giving up electricity because it caused so much disruption to the kerosene and candle

business. Few would suggest holding back on improvements in medical technology because they might cause

companies selling leeches and snake oil to lose money. In short, most people view disruptions due to

technological change as a necessary cost that is worth bearing.

Now, imagine that Technotron’s new “technology” is as simple as this: the company imports what it sells from

another country. In other words, think of foreign trade as a type of innovative technology. The objective

situation is now exactly the same as before. Because of Technotron’s new technology—which in this case is

importing goods from another county—other firms in this industry will lose money and lay off workers. Just as

it would have been inappropriate and ultimately foolish to respond to the disruptions of new scientific

technology by trying to shut it down, it would be inappropriate and ultimately foolish to respond to the

disruptions of international trade by trying to restrict trade.

Some workers and firms will suffer because of international trade. In a living, breathing market-oriented

economy, some workers and firms will always be experiencing disruptions, for a wide variety of reasons.

Corporate management can be better or worse. Workers for a certain firm can be more or less productive.

Tough domestic competitors can create just as much disruption as tough foreign competitors. Sometimes a

new product is a hit with consumers; sometimes it is a flop. Sometimes a company is blessed by a run of good

luck or stricken with a run of bad luck. For some firms, international trade will offer great opportunities for

expanding productivity and jobs; for other firms, trade will impose stress and pain. The disruption caused by

international trade is not fundamentally different from all the other disruptions caused by the other workings

of a market economy.

In other words, the economic analysis of free trade does not rely on a belief that foreign trade is not disruptive

or does not pose tradeoffs; indeed, the story of Technotron begins with a particular disruptive market

change—a new technology—that causes real tradeoffs. In thinking about the disruptions of foreign trade, or any

of the other possible costs and tradeoffs of foreign trade discussed in this chapter, the best public policy

solutions typically do not involve protectionism, but instead involve finding ways for public policy to address

the particular issues resulting from these disruptions, costs, and tradeoffs, while still allowing the benefits of
international trade to occur.

What’s the Downside of Protection?
The domestic flat-panel display industry employed many workers before the ITC imposed the dumping margin tax.

Flat-panel displays make up a significant portion of the cost of producing laptop computers—as much as 50%.

Therefore, the antidumping tax would substantially increase the cost, and thus the price, of U.S.-manufactured

laptops. As a result of the ITC’s decision, Apple moved its domestic manufacturing plant for Macintosh computers to

Ireland (where it had an existing plant). Toshiba shut down its U.S. manufacturing plant for laptops. And IBM

cancelled plans to open a laptop manufacturing plant in North Carolina, instead deciding to expand production at its

plant in Japan. In this case, rather than having the desired effect of protecting U.S. interests and giving domestic

manufacturing an advantage over items manufactured elsewhere, it had the unintended effect of driving the

manufacturing completely out of the country. Many people lost their jobs and most flat-panel display production

now occurs in countries other than the United States.

Key Concepts and Summary

21.1 Protectionism: An Indirect Subsidy from Consumers to Producers

There are three tools for restricting the flow of trade: tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers. When a

country places limitations on imports from abroad, regardless of whether it uses tariffs, quotas, or nontariff

barriers, it is said to be practicing protectionism. Protectionism will raise the price of the protected good in the

domestic market, which causes domestic consumers to pay more, but domestic producers to earn more.

21.2 International Trade and Its Effects on Jobs, Wages, and Working Conditions

As international trade increases, it contributes to a shift in jobs away from industries where that economy does

not have a comparative advantage and toward industries where it does have a comparative advantage. The

degree to which trade affects labor markets has much to do with the structure of the labor market in that

country and the adjustment process in other industries. Global trade should raise the average level of wages by

increasing productivity. However, this increase in average wages may include both gains to workers in certain

jobs and industries and losses to others.

In thinking about labor practices in low-income countries, it is useful to draw a line between what is

unpleasant to think about and what is morally objectionable. For example, low wages and long working hours

in poor countries are unpleasant to think about, but for people in low-income parts of the world, it may well be

the best option open to them. Practices like child labor and forced labor are morally objectionable and many

countries refuse to import products made using these practices.

21.3 Arguments in Support of Restricting Imports

There are a number of arguments that support restricting imports. These arguments are based around

526 21 • Self-Check Questions

industry and competition, environmental concerns, and issues of safety and security.

The infant industry argument for protectionism is that small domestic industries need to be temporarily

nurtured and protected from foreign competition for a time so that they can grow into strong competitors. In

some cases, notably in East Asia, this approach has worked. Often, however, the infant industries never grow

up. On the other hand, arguments against dumping (which is setting prices below the cost of production to

drive competitors out of the market), often simply seem to be a convenient excuse for imposing protectionism.

Low-income countries typically have lower environmental standards than high-income countries because they

are more worried about immediate basics such as food, education, and healthcare. However, except for a small

number of extreme cases, shutting off trade seems unlikely to be an effective method of pursuing a cleaner

environment.

Finally, there are arguments involving safety and security. Under the rules of the World Trade Organization,

countries are allowed to set whatever standards for product safety they wish, but the standards must be the

same for domestic products as for imported products and there must be a scientific basis for the standard. The

national interest argument for protectionism holds that it is unwise to import certain key products because if

the nation becomes dependent on key imported supplies, it could be vulnerable to a cutoff. However, it is often

wiser to stockpile resources and to use foreign supplies when available, rather than preemptively restricting

foreign supplies so as not to become dependent on them.

21.4 How Governments Enact Trade Policy: Globally, Regionally, and Nationally

Governments determine trade policy at many different levels: administrative agencies within government,

laws passed by the legislature, regional negotiations between a small group of nations (sometimes just two),

and global negotiations through the World Trade Organization. During the second half of the twentieth century,

trade barriers have, in general, declined quite substantially in the United States economy and in the global

economy. One reason why countries sign international trade agreements to commit themselves to free trade is

to give themselves protection against their own special interests. When an industry lobbies for protection from

foreign producers, politicians can point out that, because of the trade treaty, their hands are tied.

21.5 The Tradeoffs of Trade Policy

International trade certainly has income distribution effects. This is hardly surprising. All domestic or

international competitive market forces are disruptive. They cause companies and industries to rise and fall.

Government has a role to play in cushioning workers against the disruptions of the market. However, just as it

would be unwise in the long term to clamp down on new technology and other causes of disruption in domestic

markets, it would be unwise to clamp down on foreign trade. In both cases, the disruption brings with it

economic benefits.

APPENDIX A

The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics

(This appendix should be consulted after first reading Welcome to Economics!) Economics is not math. There

is no important concept in this course that cannot be explained without mathematics. That said, math is a tool

that can be used to illustrate economic concepts. Remember the saying a picture is worth a thousand words?

Instead of a picture, think of a graph. It is the same thing. Economists use models as the primary tool to derive

insights about economic issues and problems. Math is one way of working with (or manipulating) economic

models.

There are other ways of representing models, such as text or narrative. But why would you use your fist to bang

a nail, if you had a hammer? Math has certain advantages over text. It disciplines your thinking by making you

specify exactly what you mean. You can get away with fuzzy thinking in your head, but you cannot when you

reduce a model to algebraic equations. At the same time, math also has disadvantages. Mathematical models

are necessarily based on simplifying assumptions, so they are not likely to be perfectly realistic. Mathematical

models also lack the nuances which can be found in narrative models. The point is that math is one tool, but it

is not the only tool or even always the best tool economists can use. So what math will you need for this book?

The answer is: little more than high school algebra and graphs. You will need to know:

• What a function is

• How to interpret the equation of a line (i.e., slope and intercept)

• How to manipulate a line (i.e., changing the slope or the intercept)

• How to compute and interpret a growth rate (i.e., percentage change)

• How to read and manipulate a graph

In this text, we will use the easiest math possible, and we will introduce it in this appendix. So if you find some

math in the book that you cannot follow, come back to this appendix to review. Like most things, math has

diminishing returns. A little math ability goes a long way; the more advanced math you bring in, the less

additional knowledge that will get you. That said, if you are going to major in economics, you should consider

learning a little calculus. It will be worth your while in terms of helping you learn advanced economics more

quickly.

Algebraic Models

Often economic models (or parts of models) are expressed in terms of mathematical functions. What is a
function? A function describes a relationship. Sometimes the relationship is a definition. For example (using

words), your professor is Adam Smith. This could be expressed as Professor = Adam Smith. Or Friends = Bob +

Shawn + Margaret.

Often in economics, functions describe cause and effect. The variable on the left-hand side is what is being

explained (“the effect”). On the right-hand side is what is doing the explaining (“the causes”). For example,

suppose your GPA was determined as follows:

This equation states that your GPA depends on three things: your combined SAT score, your class attendance,

and the number of hours you spend studying. It also says that study time is twice as important (0.50) as either

combined_SAT score (0.25) or class_attendance (0.25). If this relationship is true, how could you raise your

GPA? By not skipping class and studying more. Note that you cannot do anything about your SAT score, since if

you are in college, you have (presumably) already taken the SATs.

Of course, economic models express relationships using economic variables, like Budget =

532 A • The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics

money_spent_on_econ_books + money_spent_on_music, assuming that the only things you buy are

economics books and music.

Most of the relationships we use in this course are expressed as linear equations of the form:

Expressing Equations Graphically

Graphs are useful for two purposes. The first is to express equations visually, and the second is to display

statistics or data. This section will discuss expressing equations visually.

To a mathematician or an economist, a variable is the name given to a quantity that may assume a range of

values. In the equation of a line presented above, x and y are the variables, with x on the horizontal axis and y

on the vertical axis, and b and m representing factors that determine the shape of the line. To see how this

equation works, consider a numerical example:

In this equation for a specific line, the b term has been set equal to 9 and the m term has been set equal to 3.

Table A1 shows the values of x and y for this given equation. Figure A1 shows this equation, and these values,

in a graph. To construct the table, just plug in a series of different values for x, and then calculate what value of

y results. In the figure, these points are plotted and a line is drawn through them.

FIGURE A1 Slope and the Algebra of Straight Lines This line graph has xon the horizontal axis and y on the vertical

axis. The y-intercept—that is, the point where the line intersects the y-axis—is 9. The slope of the line is 3; that is,

there is a rise of 3 on the vertical axis for every increase of 1 on the horizontal axis. The slope is the same all along a

straight line.

This example illustrates how the b and m terms in an equation for a straight line determine the shape of the

line. The b term is called the y-intercept. The reason for this name is that, if x = 0, then the b term will reveal

where the line intercepts, or crosses, the y-axis. In this example, the line hits the vertical axis at 9. The m term

in the equation for the line is the slope. Remember that slope is defined as rise over run; more specifically, the

slope of a line from one point to another is the change in the vertical axis divided by the change in the

horizontal axis. In this example, each time the x term increases by one (the run), the y term rises by three.

Thus, the slope of this line is three. Specifying a y-intercept and a slope—that is, specifying b and m in the

equation for a line—will identify a specific line. Although it is rare for real-world data points to arrange

themselves as an exact straight line, it often turns out that a straight line can offer a reasonable approximation

of actual data.

Interpreting the Slope

The concept of slope is very useful in economics, because it measures the relationship between two variables.

A positive slope means that two variables are positively related; that is, when x increases, so does y, or when x

decreases, y decreases also. Graphically, a positive slope means that as a line on the line graph moves from left

to right, the line rises. The length-weight relationship, shown in Figure A3 later in this Appendix, has a positive

slope. We will learn in other chapters that price and quantity supplied have a positive relationship; that is,
firms will supply more when the price is higher.

A negative slope means that two variables are negatively related; that is, when x increases, y decreases, or

when x decreases, y increases. Graphically, a negative slope means that, as the line on the line graph moves

from left to right, the line falls. The altitude-air density relationship, shown in Figure A4 later in this appendix,

has a negative slope. We will learn that price and quantity demanded have a negative relationship; that is,

consumers will purchase less when the price is higher.

A slope of zero means that there is no relationship between x and y. Graphically, the line is flat; that is, zero rise

over the run. Figure A5 of the unemployment rate, shown later in this appendix, illustrates a common pattern

of many line graphs: some segments where the slope is positive, other segments where the slope is negative,

and still other segments where the slope is close to zero.

The slope of a straight line between two points can be calculated in numerical terms. To calculate slope, begin

by designating one point as the “starting point” and the other point as the “end point” and then calculating the

rise over run between these two points. As an example, consider the slope of the air density graph between the

534 A • The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics

points representing an altitude of 4,000 meters and an altitude of 6,000 meters:

Rise: Change in variable on vertical axis (end point minus original point)

Run: Change in variable on horizontal axis (end point minus original point)

Thus, the slope of a straight line between these two points would be that from the altitude of 4,000 meters up to

6,000 meters, the density of the air decreases by approximately 0.1 kilograms/cubic meter for each of the next

1,000 meters.

Suppose the slope of a line were to increase. Graphically, that means it would get steeper. Suppose the slope of

a line were to decrease. Then it would get flatter. These conditions are true whether or not the slope was

positive or negative to begin with. A higher positive slope means a steeper upward tilt to the line, while a

smaller positive slope means a flatter upward tilt to the line. A negative slope that is larger in absolute value

(that is, more negative) means a steeper downward tilt to the line. A slope of zero is a horizontal flat line. A
vertical line has an infinite slope.

Suppose a line has a larger intercept. Graphically, that means it would shift out (or up) from the old origin,

parallel to the old line. If a line has a smaller intercept, it would shift in (or down), parallel to the old line.

Solving Models with Algebra

Economists often use models to answer a specific question, like: What will the unemployment rate be if the

economy grows at 3% per year? Answering specific questions requires solving the “system” of equations that

represent the model.

Suppose the demand for personal pizzas is given by the following equation:

where Qd is the amount of personal pizzas consumers want to buy (i.e., quantity demanded), and P is the price

of pizzas. Suppose the supply of personal pizzas is:

where Qs is the amount of pizza producers will supply (i.e., quantity supplied).

Finally, suppose that the personal pizza market operates where supply equals demand, or

We now have a system of three equations and three unknowns (Qd, Qs, and P), which we can solve with algebra:

Since Qd = Qs, we can set the demand and supply equation equal to each other:

Subtracting 2 from both sides and adding 2P to both sides yields:

In other words, the price of each personal pizza will be $2. How much will consumers buy?

Access for free at openstax.org

Taking the price of $2, and plugging it into the demand equation, we get:

A • The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics 535

So if the price is $2 each, consumers will purchase 12. How much will producers supply? Taking the price of

$2, and plugging it into the supply equation, we get:

So if the price is $2 each, producers will supply 12 personal pizzas. This means we did our math correctly,

since Qd = Qs.

Solving Models with Graphs

If algebra is not your forte, you can get the same answer by using graphs. Take the equations for Qd and Qs and

graph them on the same set of axes as shown in Figure A2. Since P is on the vertical axis, it is easiest if you

solve each equation for P. The demand curve is then P = 8 – 0.5Qd and the supply curve is P = –0.4 + 0.2Qs.

Note that the vertical intercepts are 8 and –0.4, and the slopes are –0.5 for demand and 0.2 for supply. If you

draw the graphs carefully, you will see that where they cross (Qs = Qd), the price is $2 and the quantity is 12,

just like the algebra predicted.

FIGURE A2 Supply and Demand Graph The equations for Qd and Qs are displayed graphically by the sloped lines.

We will use graphs more frequently in this book than algebra, but now you know the math behind the graphs.

Growth Rates

Growth rates are frequently encountered in real world economics. A growth rate is simply the percentage

change in some quantity. It could be your income. It could be a business’s sales. It could be a nation’s GDP. The

formula for computing a growth rate is straightforward:

Suppose your job pays $10 per hour. Your boss, however, is so impressed with your work that he gives you a $2

per hour raise. The percentage change (or growth rate) in your pay is $2/$10 = 0.20 or 20%.

To compute the growth rate for data over an extended period of time, for example, the average annual growth

in GDP over a decade or more, the denominator is commonly defined a little differently. In the previous

example, we defined the quantity as the initial quantity—or the quantity when we started. This is fine for a one-

time calculation, but when we compute the growth over and over, it makes more sense to define the quantity as

the average quantity over the period in question, which is defined as the quantity halfway between the initial

536 A • The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics

quantity and the next quantity. This is harder to explain in words than to show with an example. Suppose a

nation’s GDP was $1 trillion in 2005 and $1.03 trillion in 2006. The growth rate between 2005 and 2006 would

be the change in GDP ($1.03 trillion – $1.00 trillion) divided by the average GDP between 2005 and 2006 ($1.03

trillion + $1.00 trillion)/2. In other words:

Note that if we used the first method, the calculation would be ($1.03 trillion – $1.00 trillion) / $1.00 trillion =

3% growth, which is approximately the same as the second, more complicated method. If you need a rough

approximation, use the first method. If you need accuracy, use the second method.

A few things to remember: A positive growth rate means the quantity is growing. A smaller growth rate means

the quantity is growing more slowly. A larger growth rate means the quantity is growing more quickly. A

negative growth rate means the quantity is decreasing.

The same change over times yields a smaller growth rate. If you got a $2 raise each year, in the first year the

growth rate would be $2/$10 = 20%, as shown above. But in the second year, the growth rate would be $2/$12 =

0.167 or 16.7% growth. In the third year, the same $2 raise would correspond to a $2/$14 = 14.2%. The moral

of the story is this: To keep the growth rate the same, the change must increase each period.

Displaying Data Graphically and Interpreting the Graph

Graphs are also used to display data or evidence. Graphs are a method of presenting numerical patterns. They

condense detailed numerical information into a visual form in which relationships and numerical patterns can

be seen more easily. For example, which countries have larger or smaller populations? A careful reader could

examine a long list of numbers representing the populations of many countries, but with over 200 nations in

the world, searching through such a list would take concentration and time. Putting these same numbers on a

graph can quickly reveal population patterns. Economists use graphs both for a compact and readable

presentation of groups of numbers and for building an intuitive grasp of relationships and connections.

Three types of graphs are used in this book: line graphs, pie graphs, and bar graphs. Each is discussed below.

We also provide warnings about how graphs can be manipulated to alter viewers’ perceptions of the

relationships in the data.

Line Graphs

The graphs we have discussed so far are called line graphs, because they show a relationship between two

variables: one measured on the horizontal axis and the other measured on the vertical axis.

Sometimes it is useful to show more than one set of data on the same axes. The data in Table A2 is displayed in

Figure A3 which shows the relationship between two variables: length and median weight for American baby

boys and girls during the first three years of life. (The median means that half of all babies weigh more than

this and half weigh less.) The line graph measures length in inches on the horizontal axis and weight in pounds

on the vertical axis. For example, point A on the figure shows that a boy who is 28 inches long will have a

median weight of about 19 pounds. One line on the graph shows the length-weight relationship for boys and

the other line shows the relationship for girls. This kind of graph is widely used by healthcare providers to

check whether a child’s physical development is roughly on track.

FIGURE A3 The Length-Weight Relationship for American Boys and Girls The line graph shows the relationship

between height and weight for boys and girls from birth to 3 years. Point A, for example, shows that a boy of 28

inches in height (measured on the horizontal axis) is typically 19 pounds in weight (measured on the vertical axis).

These data apply only to children in the first three years of life.

TABLE A2 Length to Weight Relationship for American Boys and Girls

Not all relationships in economics are linear. Sometimes they are curves. Figure A4 presents another example

of a line graph, representing the data from Table A3. In this case, the line graph shows how thin the air

becomes when you climb a mountain. The horizontal axis of the figure shows altitude, measured in meters

above sea level. The vertical axis measures the density of the air at each altitude. Air density is measured by

the weight of the air in a cubic meter of space (that is, a box measuring one meter in height, width, and depth).

538 A • The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics

As the graph shows, air pressure is heaviest at ground level and becomes lighter as you climb. Figure A4 shows

that a cubic meter of air at an altitude of 500 meters weighs approximately one kilogram (about 2.2 pounds).

However, as the altitude increases, air density decreases. A cubic meter of air at the top of Mount Everest, at

about 8,828 meters, would weigh only 0.023 kilograms. The thin air at high altitudes explains why many

mountain climbers need to use oxygen tanks as they reach the top of a mountain.

FIGURE A4 Altitude-Air Density Relationship This line graph shows the relationship between altitude, measured in

meters above sea level, and air density, measured in kilograms of air per cubic meter. As altitude rises, air density

declines. The point at the top of Mount Everest has an altitude of approximately 8,828 meters above sea level (the

horizontal axis) and air density of 0.023 kilograms per cubic meter (the vertical axis).

TABLE A3 Altitude to Air Density Relationship

The length-weight relationship and the altitude-air density relationships in these two figures represent

averages. If you were to collect actual data on air pressure at different altitudes, the same altitude in different

geographic locations will have slightly different air density, depending on factors like how far you are from the

equator, local weather conditions, and the humidity in the air. Similarly, in measuring the height and weight of

children for the previous line graph, children of a particular height would have a range of different weights,

some above average and some below. In the real world, this sort of variation in data is common. The task of a

researcher is to organize that data in a way that helps to understand typical patterns. The study of statistics,

especially when combined with computer statistics and spreadsheet programs, is a great help in organizing

this kind of data, plotting line graphs, and looking for typical underlying relationships. For most economics

and social science majors, a statistics course will be required at some point.

One common line graph is called a time series, in which the horizontal axis shows time and the vertical axis

displays another variable. Thus, a time series graph shows how a variable changes over time. Figure A5 shows

the unemployment rate in the United States since 1975, where unemployment is defined as the percentage of

adults who want jobs and are looking for a job, but cannot find one. The points for the unemployment rate in

each year are plotted on the graph, and a line then connects the points, showing how the unemployment rate

has moved up and down since 1975. The line graph makes it easy to see, for example, that the highest

unemployment rate during this time period was slightly less than 10% in the early 1980s and 2010, while the

unemployment rate declined from the early 1990s to the end of the 1990s, before rising and then falling back

in the early 2000s, and then rising sharply during the recession from 2008–2009.

540 A • The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics

FIGURE A5 U.S. Unemployment Rate, 1975–2014 This graph provides a quick visual summary of unemployment

data. With a graph like this, it is easy to spot the times of high unemployment and of low unemployment.

Pie Graphs

A pie graph (sometimes called a pie chart) is used to show how an overall total is divided into parts. A circle
represents a group as a whole. The slices of this circular “pie” show the relative sizes of subgroups.

Figure A6 shows how the U.S. population was divided among children, working age adults, and the elderly in

1970, 2000, and what is projected for 2030. The information is first conveyed with numbers in Table A4, and

then in three pie charts. The first column of Table A4 shows the total U.S. population for each of the three

years. Columns 2–4 categorize the total in terms of age groups—from birth to 18 years, from 19 to 64 years, and

65 years and above. In columns 2–4, the first number shows the actual number of people in each age category,

while the number in parentheses shows the percentage of the total population comprised by that age group.

A • The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics 541

FIGURE A6 Pie Graphs of the U.S. Age Distribution (numbers in millions) The three pie graphs illustrate the division

of total population into three age groups for the three different years.

In a pie graph, each slice of the pie represents a share of the total, or a percentage. For example, 50% would be

half of the pie and 20% would be one-fifth of the pie. The three pie graphs in Figure A6 show that the share of

the U.S. population 65 and over is growing. The pie graphs allow you to get a feel for the relative size of the

different age groups from 1970 to 2000 to 2030, without requiring you to slog through the specific numbers

and percentages in the table. Some common examples of how pie graphs are used include dividing the

population into groups by age, income level, ethnicity, religion, occupation; dividing different firms into

categories by size, industry, number of employees; and dividing up government spending or taxes into its main

categories.

Bar Graphs

A bar graph uses the height of different bars to compare quantities. Table A5 lists the 12 most populous

countries in the world. Figure A7 provides this same data in a bar graph. The height of the bars corresponds to

the population of each country. Although you may know that China and India are the most populous countries

in the world, seeing how the bars on the graph tower over the other countries helps illustrate the magnitude of

the difference between the sizes of national populations.

Bar graphs can be subdivided in a way that reveals information similar to that we can get from pie charts.

Figure A8 offers three bar graphs based on the information from Figure A6 about the U.S. age distribution in

1970, 2000, and 2030. Figure A8 (a) shows three bars for each year, representing the total number of persons

in each age bracket for each year. Figure A8 (b) shows just one bar for each year, but the different age groups

are now shaded inside the bar. In Figure A8 (c), still based on the same data, the vertical axis measures

percentages rather than the number of persons. In this case, all three bar graphs are the same height,

representing 100% of the population, with each bar divided according to the percentage of population in each

age group. It is sometimes easier for a reader to run their eyes across several bar graphs, comparing the

shaded areas, rather than trying to compare several pie graphs.

FIGURE A8 U.S. Population with Bar Graphs Population data can be represented in different ways. (a) Shows three

bars for each year, representing the total number of persons in each age bracket for each year. (b) Shows just one

bar for each year, but the different age groups are now shaded inside the bar. (c) Sets the vertical axis as a measure

of percentages rather than the number of persons. All three bar graphs are the same height and each bar is divided

according to the percentage of population in each age group.

Figure A7 and Figure A8 show how the bars can represent countries or years, and how the vertical axis can

represent a numerical or a percentage value. Bar graphs can also compare size, quantity, rates, distances, and

other quantitative categories.

Comparing Line Graphs with Pie Charts and Bar Graphs

Now that you are familiar with pie graphs, bar graphs, and line graphs, how do you know which graph to use for

your data? Pie graphs are often better than line graphs at showing how an overall group is divided. However, if

a pie graph has too many slices, it can become difficult to interpret.

Bar graphs are especially useful when comparing quantities. For example, if you are studying the populations

of different countries, as in Figure A7, bar graphs can show the relationships between the population sizes of

multiple countries. Not only can it show these relationships, but it can also show breakdowns of different

groups within the population.

544 A • The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics

A line graph is often the most effective format for illustrating a relationship between two variables that are both

changing. For example, time series graphs can show patterns as time changes, like the unemployment rate

over time. Line graphs are widely used in economics to present continuous data about prices, wages, quantities

bought and sold, the size of the economy.

How Graphs Can Be Misleading

Graphs not only reveal patterns; they can also alter how patterns are perceived. To see some of the ways this

can be done, consider the line graphs of Figure A9, Figure A10, and Figure A11. These graphs all illustrate the

unemployment rate—but from different perspectives.

FIGURE A9

A • The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics 545

FIGURE A10 Presenting Unemployment Rates in Different Ways, All of Them Accurate Simply changing the width

and height of the area in which data is displayed can alter the perception of the data.

546 A • The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics

FIGURE A11 Presenting Unemployment Rates in Different Ways, All of Them Accurate Simply changing the width

and height of the area in which data is displayed can alter the perception of the data.

Suppose you wanted a graph which gives the impression that the rise in unemployment in 2009 was not all

that large, or all that extraordinary by historical standards. You might choose to present your data as in Figure

A9 (a). Figure A9 (a) includes much of the same data presented earlier in Figure A5, but stretches the

horizontal axis out longer relative to the vertical axis. By spreading the graph wide and flat, the visual

appearance is that the rise in unemployment is not so large, and is similar to some past rises in

unemployment. Now imagine you wanted to emphasize how unemployment spiked substantially higher in

2009. In this case, using the same data, you can stretch the vertical axis out relative to the horizontal axis, as in

Figure A9 (b), which makes all rises and falls in unemployment appear larger.

A similar effect can be accomplished without changing the length of the axes, but by changing the scale on the

vertical axis. In Figure A10 (c), the scale on the vertical axis runs from 0% to 30%, while in Figure A10 (d), the

vertical axis runs from 3% to 10%. Compared to Figure A5, where the vertical scale runs from 0% to 12%,

Figure A10 (c) makes the fluctuation in unemployment look smaller, while Figure A10 (d) makes it look larger.

Another way to alter the perception of the graph is to reduce the amount of variation by changing the number

of points plotted on the graph. Figure A10 (e) shows the unemployment rate according to five-year averages. By

averaging out some of the year-to-year changes, the line appears smoother and with fewer highs and lows. In

reality, the unemployment rate is reported monthly, and Figure A11 (f) shows the monthly figures since 1960,

which fluctuate more than the five-year average. Figure A11 (f) is also a vivid illustration of how graphs can

Access for free at openstax.org

A • The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics 547

compress lots of data. The graph includes monthly data since 1960, which over almost 50 years, works out to

nearly 600 data points. Reading that list of 600 data points in numerical form would be hypnotic. You can,

however, get a good intuitive sense of these 600 data points very quickly from the graph.

A final trick in manipulating the perception of graphical information is that, by choosing the starting and

ending points carefully, you can influence the perception of whether the variable is rising or falling. The

original data show a general pattern with unemployment low in the 1960s, but spiking up in the mid-1970s,

early 1980s, early 1990s, early 2000s, and late 2000s. Figure A11 (g), however, shows a graph that goes back

only to 1975, which gives an impression that unemployment was more-or-less gradually falling over time until

the 2009 recession pushed it back up to its “original” level—which is a plausible interpretation if one starts at

the high point around 1975.

These kinds of tricks—or shall we just call them “presentation choices”— are not limited to line graphs. In a pie

chart with many small slices and one large slice, someone must decide what categories should be used to

produce these slices in the first place, thus making some slices appear bigger than others. If you are making a

bar graph, you can make the vertical axis either taller or shorter, which will tend to make variations in the

height of the bars appear more or less.

Being able to read graphs is an essential skill, both in economics and in life. A graph is just one perspective or

point of view, shaped by choices such as those discussed in this section. Do not always believe the first quick

impression from a graph. View with caution.

Key Concepts and Summary

Math is a tool for understanding economics and economic relationships can be expressed mathematically

using algebra or graphs. The algebraic equation for a line is y = b + mx, where x is the variable on the

horizontal axis and y is the variable on the vertical axis, the b term is the y-intercept and the m term is the

slope. The slope of a line is the same at any point on the line and it indicates the relationship (positive,

negative, or zero) between two economic variables.

Economic models can be solved algebraically or graphically. Graphs allow you to illustrate data visually. They

can illustrate patterns, comparisons, trends, and apportionment by condensing the numerical data and

providing an intuitive sense of relationships in the data. A line graph shows the relationship between two

variables: one is shown on the horizontal axis and one on the vertical axis. A pie graph shows how something is

allotted, such as a sum of money or a group of people. The size of each slice of the pie is drawn to represent the

corresponding percentage of the whole. A bar graph uses the height of bars to show a relationship, where each

bar represents a certain entity, like a country or a group of people. The bars on a bar graph can also be divided

into segments to show subgroups.

Any graph is a single visual perspective on a subject. The impression it leaves will be based on many choices,

such as what data or time frame is included, how data or groups are divided up, the relative size of vertical and

horizontal axes, whether the scale used on a vertical starts at zero. Thus, any graph should be regarded

somewhat skeptically, remembering that the underlying relationship can be open to different interpretations.

APPENDIX B

B • The Expenditure-Output Model 549

The Expenditure-Output Model

(This appendix should be consulted after first reading The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model and

The Keynesian Perspective.) The fundamental ideas of Keynesian economics were developed before the AD/AS

model was popularized. From the 1930s until the 1970s, Keynesian economics was usually explained with a

different model, known as the expenditure-output approach. This approach is strongly rooted in the

fundamental assumptions of Keynesian economics: it focuses on the total amount of spending in the economy,

with no explicit mention of aggregate supply or of the price level (although as you will see, it is possible to draw

some inferences about aggregate supply and price levels based on the diagram).

The Axes of the Expenditure-Output Diagram

The expenditure-output model, sometimes also called the Keynesian cross diagram, determines the
equilibrium level of real GDP by the point where the total or aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal

to the amount of output produced. The axes of the Keynesian cross diagram presented in Figure B1 show real

GDP on the horizontal axis as a measure of output and aggregate expenditures on the vertical axis as a

measure of spending.

FIGURE B1 The Expenditure-Output Diagram The aggregate expenditure-output model shows aggregate

expenditures on the vertical axis and real GDP on the horizontal axis. A vertical line shows potential GDP where full

employment occurs. The 45-degree line shows all points where aggregate expenditures and output are equal. The

aggregate expenditure schedule shows how total spending or aggregate expenditure increases as output or real

GDP rises. The intersection of the aggregate expenditure schedule and the 45-degree line will be the equilibrium.
Equilibrium occurs at E0, where aggregate expenditure AE0 is equal to the output level Y0.

Remember that GDP can be thought of in several equivalent ways: it measures both the value of spending on

final goods and also the value of the production of final goods. All sales of the final goods and services that

make up GDP will eventually end up as income for workers, for managers, and for investors and owners of

firms. The sum of all the income received for contributing resources to GDP is called national income (Y). At

some points in the discussion that follows, it will be useful to refer to real GDP as “national income.” Both axes

are measured in real (inflation-adjusted) terms.

550 B • The Expenditure-Output Model

The Potential GDP Line and the 45-degree Line

The Keynesian cross diagram contains two lines that serve as conceptual guideposts to orient the discussion.

The first is a vertical line showing the level of potential GDP. Potential GDP means the same thing here that it

means in the AD/AS diagrams: it refers to the quantity of output that the economy can produce with full

employment of its labor and physical capital.

The second conceptual line on the Keynesian cross diagram is the 45-degree line, which starts at the origin

and reaches up and to the right. A line that stretches up at a 45-degree angle represents the set of points (1, 1),

(2, 2), (3, 3) and so on, where the measurement on the vertical axis is equal to the measurement on the

horizontal axis. In this diagram, the 45-degree line shows the set of points where the level of aggregate

expenditure in the economy, measured on the vertical axis, is equal to the level of output or national income in

the economy, measured by GDP on the horizontal axis.

When the macroeconomy is in equilibrium, it must be true that the aggregate expenditures in the economy are

equal to the real GDP—because by definition, GDP is the measure of what is spent on final sales of goods and

services in the economy. Thus, the equilibrium calculated with a Keynesian cross diagram will always end up

where aggregate expenditure and output are equal—which will only occur along the 45-degree line.

The Aggregate Expenditure Schedule

The final ingredient of the Keynesian cross or expenditure-output diagram is the aggregate expenditure

schedule, which will show the total expenditures in the economy for each level of real GDP. The intersection of
the aggregate expenditure line with the 45-degree line—at point E0 in Figure B1—will show the equilibrium for
the economy, because it is the point where aggregate expenditure is equal to output or real GDP. After

developing an understanding of what the aggregate expenditures schedule means, we will return to this

equilibrium and how to interpret it.

Building the Aggregate Expenditure Schedule

Aggregate expenditure is the key to the expenditure-income model. The aggregate expenditure schedule

shows, either in the form of a table or a graph, how aggregate expenditures in the economy rise as real GDP or

national income rises. Thus, in thinking about the components of the aggregate expenditure

line—consumption, investment, government spending, exports and imports—the key question is how

expenditures in each category will adjust as national income rises.

Consumption as a Function of National Income

How do consumption expenditures increase as national income rises? People can do two things with their

income: consume it or save it (for the moment, let’s ignore the need to pay taxes with some of it). Each person
who receives an additional dollar faces this choice. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC), is the share of

the additional dollar of income a person decides to devote to consumption expenditures. The marginal

propensity to save (MPS) is the share of the additional dollar a person decides to save. It must always hold true

that:

For example, if the marginal propensity to consume out of the marginal amount of income earned is 0.9, then

the marginal propensity to save is 0.1.

With this relationship in mind, consider the relationship among income, consumption, and savings shown in

Figure B2. (Note that we use “Aggregate Expenditure” on the vertical axis in this and the following figures,

because all consumption expenditures are parts of aggregate expenditures.)

An assumption commonly made in this model is that even if income were zero, people would have to consume

something. In this example, consumption would be $600 even if income were zero. Then, the MPC is 0.8 and

the MPS is 0.2. Thus, when income increases by $1,000, consumption rises by $800 and savings rises by $200.

Access for free at openstax.org

B • The Expenditure-Output Model 551

At an income of $4,000, total consumption will be the $600 that would be consumed even without any income,

plus $4,000 multiplied by the marginal propensity to consume of 0.8, or $ 3,200, for a total of $ 3,800. The total

amount of consumption and saving must always add up to the total amount of income. (Exactly how a situation

of zero income and negative savings would work in practice is not important, because even low-income

societies are not literally at zero income, so the point is hypothetical.) This relationship between income and

consumption, illustrated in Figure B2 and Table B1, is called the consumption function.

FIGURE B2 The Consumption Function In the expenditure-output model, how does consumption increase with the

level of national income? Output on the horizontal axis is conceptually the same as national income, since the value

of all final output that is produced and sold must be income to someone, somewhere in the economy. At a national

income level of zero, $600 is consumed. Then, each time income rises by $1,000, consumption rises by $800,

because in this example, the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8.

The pattern of consumption shown in Table B1 is plotted in Figure B2. To calculate consumption, multiply the

income level by 0.8, for the marginal propensity to consume, and add $600, for the amount that would be

consumed even if income was zero. Consumption plus savings must be equal to income.

TABLE B1 The Consumption

Function

However, a number of factors other than income can also cause the entire consumption function to shift. These

factors were summarized in the earlier discussion of consumption, and listed in Table B1. When the

consumption function moves, it can shift in two ways: either the entire consumption function can move up or

down in a parallel manner, or the slope of the consumption function can shift so that it becomes steeper or

flatter. For example, if a tax cut leads consumers to spend more, but does not affect their marginal propensity

to consume, it would cause an upward shift to a new consumption function that is parallel to the original one.

However, a change in household preferences for saving that reduced the marginal propensity to save would

cause the slope of the consumption function to become steeper: that is, if the savings rate is lower, then every

increase in income leads to a larger rise in consumption.

Investment as a Function of National Income

Investment decisions are forward-looking, based on expected rates of return. Precisely because investment

decisions depend primarily on perceptions about future economic conditions, they do notdepend primarily on

the level of GDP in the current year. Thus, on a Keynesian cross diagram, the investment function can be drawn

as a horizontal line, at a fixed level of expenditure. Figure B3 shows an investment function where the level of

investment is, for the sake of concreteness, set at the specific level of 500. Just as a consumption function

shows the relationship between consumption levels and real GDP (or national income), the investment

function shows the relationship between investment levels and real GDP.

FIGURE B3 The Investment Function The investment function is drawn as a flat line because investment is based

on interest rates and expectations about the future, and so it does not change with the level of current national

income. In this example, investment expenditures are at a level of 500. However, changes in factors like

technological opportunities, expectations about near-term economic growth, and interest rates would all cause the

investment function to shift up or down.

The appearance of the investment function as a horizontal line does not mean that the level of investment

never moves. It means only that in the context of this two-dimensional diagram, the level of investment on the

vertical aggregate expenditure axis does not vary according to the current level of real GDP on the horizontal

Access for free at openstax.org

B • The Expenditure-Output Model 553

axis. However, all the other factors that vary investment—new technological opportunities, expectations about

near-term economic growth, interest rates, the price of key inputs, and tax incentives for investment—can

cause the horizontal investment function to shift up or down.

Government Spending and Taxes as a Function of National Income

In the Keynesian cross diagram, government spending appears as a horizontal line, as in Figure B4, where

government spending is set at a level of 1,300. As in the case of investment spending, this horizontal line does

not mean that government spending is unchanging. It means only that government spending changes when

Congress decides on a change in the budget, rather than shifting in a predictable way with the current size of

the real GDP shown on the horizontal axis.

FIGURE B4 The Government Spending Function The level of government spending is determined by political

factors, not by the level of real GDP in a given year. Thus, government spending is drawn as a horizontal line. In this

example, government spending is at a level of 1,300. Congressional decisions to increase government spending will

cause this horizontal line to shift up, while decisions to reduce spending would cause it to shift down.

The situation of taxes is different because taxes often rise or fall with the volume of economic activity. For

example, income taxes are based on the level of income earned and sales taxes are based on the amount of

sales made, and both income and sales tend to be higher when the economy is growing and lower when the

economy is in a recession. For the purposes of constructing the basic Keynesian cross diagram, it is helpful to

view taxes as a proportionate share of GDP. In the United States, for example, taking federal, state, and local

taxes together, government typically collects about 30–35 % of income as taxes.

Table B2 revises the earlier table on the consumption function so that it takes taxes into account. The first

column shows national income. The second column calculates taxes, which in this example are set at a rate of

30%, or 0.3. The third column shows after-tax income; that is, total income minus taxes. The fourth column

then calculates consumption in the same manner as before: multiply after-tax income by 0.8, representing the

marginal propensity to consume, and then add $600, for the amount that would be consumed even if income

was zero. When taxes are included, the marginal propensity to consume is reduced by the amount of the tax

rate, so each additional dollar of income results in a smaller increase in consumption than before taxes. For

this reason, the consumption function, with taxes included, is flatter than the consumption function without

taxes, as Figure B5 shows.

FIGURE B5 The Consumption Function Before and After Taxes The upper line repeats the consumption function

from Figure B2. The lower line shows the consumption function if taxes must first be paid on income, and then

consumption is based on after-tax income.

TABLE B2 The Consumption Function Before and After Taxes

Exports and Imports as a Function of National Income

The export function, which shows how exports change with the level of a country’s own real GDP, is drawn as a

horizontal line, as in the example in Figure B6 (a) where exports are drawn at a level of $840. Again, as in the

case of investment spending and government spending, drawing the export function as horizontal does not

imply that exports never change. It just means that they do not change because of what is on the horizontal

axis—that is, a country’s own level of domestic production—and instead are shaped by the level of aggregate
demand in other countries. More demand for exports from other countries would cause the export function to

shift up; less demand for exports from other countries would cause it to shift down.

B • The Expenditure-Output Model 555

FIGURE B6 The Export and Import Functions (a) The export function is drawn as a horizontal line because exports

are determined by the buying power of other countries and thus do not change with the size of the domestic

economy. In this example, exports are set at 840. However, exports can shift up or down, depending on buying

patterns in other countries. (b) The import function is drawn in negative territory because expenditures on imported

products are a subtraction from expenditures in the domestic economy. In this example, the marginal propensity to

import is 0.1, so imports are calculated by multiplying the level of income by –0.1.

Imports are drawn in the Keynesian cross diagram as a downward-sloping line, with the downward slope

determined by the marginal propensity to import (MPI), out of national income. In Figure B6 (b), the marginal

propensity to import is 0.1. Thus, if real GDP is $5,000, imports are $500; if national income is $6,000, imports

are $600, and so on. The import function is drawn as downward sloping and negative, because it represents a

subtraction from the aggregate expenditures in the domestic economy. A change in the marginal propensity to

import, perhaps as a result of changes in preferences, would alter the slope of the import function.

WORK IT OUT

Using an Algebraic Approach to the Expenditure-Output Model
In the expenditure-output or Keynesian cross model, the equilibrium occurs where the aggregate expenditure

line (AE line) crosses the 45-degree line. Given algebraic equations for two lines, the point where they cross can

be readily calculated. Imagine an economy with the following characteristics.

Y = Real GDP or national income

T = Taxes = 0.3Y

C = Consumption = 140 + 0.9(Y – T)

I = Investment = 400

G = Government spending = 800

X = Exports = 600

M = Imports = 0.15Y

Step 1. Determine the aggregate expenditure function. In this case, it is:

Step 2. The equation for the 45-degree line is the set of points where GDP or national income on the horizontal

556 B • The Expenditure-Output Model

axis is equal to aggregate expenditure on the vertical axis. Thus, the equation for the 45-degree line is: AE = Y.

Step 3. The next step is to solve these two equations for Y (or AE, since they will be equal to each other).

Substitute Y for AE:

Step 4. Insert the term 0.3Y for the tax rate T. This produces an equation with only one variable, Y.

Step 5. Work through the algebra and solve for Y.

This algebraic framework is flexible and useful in predicting how economic events and policy actions will affect

real GDP.

Step 6. Say, for example, that because of changes in the relative prices of domestic and foreign goods, the

marginal propensity to import falls to 0.1. Calculate the equilibrium output when the marginal propensity to

import is changed to 0.1.

Step 7. Because of a surge of business confidence, investment rises to 500. Calculate the equilibrium output.

For issues of policy, the key questions would be how to adjust government spending levels or tax rates so that

the equilibrium level of output is the full employment level. In this case, let the economic parameters be:

Y = National income

T = Taxes = 0.3Y

C = Consumption = 200 + 0.9(Y – T)

I = Investment = 600

G = Government spending = 1,000

X = Exports = 600

Y = Imports = 0.1(Y – T)

Step 8. Calculate the equilibrium for this economy (remember Y = AE).

Access for free at openstax.org

B • The Expenditure-Output Model 557

Step 9. Assume that the full employment level of output is 6,000. What level of government spending would be

necessary to reach that level? To answer this question, plug in 6,000 as equal to Y, but leave G as a variable, and

solve for G. Thus:

Step 10. Solve this problem arithmetically. The answer is: G = 1,240. In other words, increasing government

spending by 240, from its original level of 1,000, to 1,240, would raise output to the full employment level of

GDP.

Indeed, the question of how much to increase government spending so that equilibrium output will rise from

5,454 to 6,000 can be answered without working through the algebra, just by using the multiplier formula. The

multiplier equation in this case is:

Thus, to raise output by 546 would require an increase in government spending of 546/2.27=240, which is the

same as the answer derived from the algebraic calculation.

This algebraic framework is highly flexible. For example, taxes can be treated as a total set by political

considerations (like government spending) and not dependent on national income. Imports might be based on

before-tax income, not after-tax income. For certain purposes, it may be helpful to analyze the economy without

exports and imports. A more complicated approach could divide up consumption, investment, government,

exports and imports into smaller categories, or to build in some variability in the rates of taxes, savings, and

imports. A wise economist will shape the model to fit the specific question under investigation.

Building the Combined Aggregate Expenditure Function

All the components of aggregate demand—consumption, investment, government spending, and the trade

balance—are now in place to build the Keynesian cross diagram. Figure B7 builds up an aggregate expenditure

function, based on the numerical illustrations of C, I, G, X, and M that have been used throughout this text. The

first three columns in Table B3 are lifted from the earlier Table B2, which showed how to bring taxes into the

consumption function. The first column is real GDP or national income, which is what appears on the

horizontal axis of the income-expenditure diagram. The second column calculates after-tax income, based on

the assumption, in this case, that 30% of real GDP is collected in taxes. The third column is based on an MPC of

0.8, so that as after-tax income rises by $700 from one row to the next, consumption rises by $560 (700 × 0.8)

from one row to the next. Investment, government spending, and exports do not change with the level of

current national income. In the previous discussion, investment was $500, government spending was $1,300,

and exports were $840, for a total of $2,640. This total is shown in the fourth column. Imports are 0.1 of real

GDP in this example, and the level of imports is calculated in the fifth column. The final column, aggregate

expenditures, sums up C + I + G + X – M. This aggregate expenditure line is illustrated in Figure B7.

558 B • The Expenditure-Output Model

FIGURE B7 A Keynesian Cross Diagram Each combination of national income and aggregate expenditure (after-tax

consumption, government spending, investment, exports, and imports) is graphed. The equilibrium occurs where

aggregate expenditure is equal to national income; this occurs where the aggregate expenditure schedule crosses

the 45-degree line, at a real GDP of $6,000. Potential GDP in this example is $7,000, so the equilibrium is occurring

at a level of output or real GDP below the potential GDP level.

The aggregate expenditure function is formed by stacking on top of each other the consumption function (after

taxes), the investment function, the government spending function, the export function, and the import

function. The point at which the aggregate expenditure function intersects the vertical axis will be determined

by the levels of investment, government, and export expenditures—which do not vary with national income.

The upward slope of the aggregate expenditure function will be determined by the marginal propensity to

save, the tax rate, and the marginal propensity to import. A higher marginal propensity to save, a higher tax

rate, and a higher marginal propensity to import will all make the slope of the aggregate expenditure function

flatter—because out of any extra income, more is going to savings or taxes or imports and less to spending on

domestic goods and services.

The equilibrium occurs where national income is equal to aggregate expenditure, which is shown on the graph

Access for free at openstax.org

B • The Expenditure-Output Model 559

as the point where the aggregate expenditure schedule crosses the 45-degree line. In this example, the

equilibrium occurs at 6,000. This equilibrium can also be read off the table under the figure; it is the level of

national income where aggregate expenditure is equal to national income.

Equilibrium in the Keynesian Cross Model

With the aggregate expenditure line in place, the next step is to relate it to the two other elements of the

Keynesian cross diagram. Thus, the first subsection interprets the intersection of the aggregate expenditure

function and the 45-degree line, while the next subsection relates this point of intersection to the potential

GDP line.

Where Equilibrium Occurs

The point where the aggregate expenditure line that is constructed from C + I + G + X – M crosses the

45-degree line will be the equilibrium for the economy. It is the only point on the aggregate expenditure line

where the total amount being spent on aggregate demand equals the total level of production. In Figure B7,
this point of equilibrium (E0) happens at 6,000, which can also be read off Table B3.

The meaning of “equilibrium” remains the same; that is, equilibrium is a point of balance where no incentive

exists to shift away from that outcome. To understand why the point of intersection between the aggregate

expenditure function and the 45-degree line is a macroeconomic equilibrium, consider what would happen if

an economy found itself to the right of the equilibrium point E, say point H in Figure B8, where output is higher

than the equilibrium. At point H, the level of aggregate expenditure is below the 45-degree line, so that the

level of aggregate expenditure in the economy is less than the level of output. As a result, at point H, output is

piling up unsold—not a sustainable state of affairs.

FIGURE B8 Equilibrium in the Keynesian Cross Diagram If output was above the equilibrium level, at H, then the

real output is greater than the aggregate expenditure in the economy. This pattern cannot hold, because it would

mean that goods are produced but piling up unsold. If output was below the equilibrium level at L, then aggregate

expenditure would be greater than output. This pattern cannot hold either, because it would mean that spending

exceeds the number of goods being produced. Only point E can be at equilibrium, where output, or national income

and aggregate expenditure, are equal. The equilibrium (E) must lie on the 45-degree line, which is the set of points

where national income and aggregate expenditure are equal.

Conversely, consider the situation where the level of output is at point L—where real output is lower than the

equilibrium. In that case, the level of aggregate demand in the economy is above the 45-degree line, indicating

that the level of aggregate expenditure in the economy is greater than the level of output. When the level of

aggregate demand has emptied the store shelves, it cannot be sustained, either. Firms will respond by

increasing their level of production. Thus, the equilibrium must be the point where the amount produced and

560 B • The Expenditure-Output Model

the amount spent are in balance, at the intersection of the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree

line.

WORK IT OUT

Finding Equilibrium
Table B4 gives some information on an economy. The Keynesian model assumes that there is some level of

consumption even without income. That amount is $236 – $216 = $20. $20 will be consumed when national

income equals zero. Assume that taxes are 0.2 of real GDP. Let the marginal propensity to save of after-tax

income be 0.1. The level of investment is $70, the level of government spending is $80, and the level of exports

is $50. Imports are 0.2 of after-tax income. Given these values, you need to complete Table B4 and then answer

these questions:

• What is the consumption function?

• What is the equilibrium?

• Why is a national income of $300 not at equilibrium?

• How do expenditures and output compare at this point?

Step 1. Calculate the amount of taxes for each level of national income(reminder: GDP = national income) for

each level of national income using the following as an example:

Step 2. Calculate after-tax income by subtracting the tax amount from national income for each level of national

income using the following as an example:

Step 3. Calculate consumption. The marginal propensity to save is given as 0.1. This means that the marginal

propensity to consume is 0.9, since MPS + MPC = 1. Therefore, multiply 0.9 by the after-tax income amount using

the following as an example:

Access for free at openstax.org

B • The Expenditure-Output Model 561

Step 4. Consider why the table shows consumption of $236 in the first row. As mentioned earlier, the Keynesian

model assumes that there is some level of consumption even without income. That amount is $236 – $216 =

$20.

Step 5. There is now enough information to write the consumption function. The consumption function is found

by figuring out the level of consumption that will happen when income is zero. Remember that:

Let C represent the consumption function, Y represent national income, and T represent taxes.

Step 6. Use the consumption function to find consumption at each level of national income.

Step 7. Add investment (I), government spending (G), and exports (X). Remember that these do not change as

national income changes:

Step 8. Find imports, which are 0.2 of after-tax income at each level of national income. For example:

Step 9. Find aggregate expenditure by adding C + I + G + X – I for each level of national income. Your completed

table should look like Table B5.

Step 10. Answer the question: What is equilibrium? Equilibrium occurs where AE = Y. Table B5 shows that

equilibrium occurs where national income equals aggregate expenditure at $500.

Step 11. Find equilibrium mathematically, knowing that national income is equal to aggregate expenditure.

Since T is 0.2 of national income, substitute T with 0.2 Y so that:

562 B • The Expenditure-Output Model

Solve for Y.

Step 12. Answer this question: Why is a national income of $300 not an equilibrium? At national income of $300,

aggregate expenditures are $388.

Step 13. Answer this question: How do expenditures and output compare at this point? Aggregate expenditures

cannot exceed output (GDP) in the long run, since there would not be enough goods to be bought.

Recessionary and Inflationary Gaps

In the Keynesian cross diagram, if the aggregate expenditure line intersects the 45-degree line at the level of

potential GDP, then the economy is in sound shape. There is no recession, and unemployment is low. But there

is no guarantee that the equilibrium will occur at the potential GDP level of output. The equilibrium might be

higher or lower.

For example, Figure B9 (a) illustrates a situation where the aggregate expenditure line intersects the 45-degree
line at point E0, which is a real GDP of $6,000, and which is below the potential GDP of $7,000. In this situation,
the level of aggregate expenditure is too low for GDP to reach its full employment level, and unemployment will
occur. The distance between an output level like E0 that is below potential GDP and the level of potential GDP is
called a recessionary gap. Because the equilibrium level of real GDP is so low, firms will not wish to hire the full

employment number of workers, and unemployment will be high.

FIGURE B9 Addressing Recessionary and Inflationary Gaps (a) If the equilibrium occurs at an output below

potential GDP, then a recessionary gap exists. The policy solution to a recessionary gap is to shift the aggregate

Access for free at openstax.org

B • The Expenditure-Output Model 563

expenditure schedule up from AE0 to AE1, using policies like tax cuts or government spending increases. Then the
new equilibrium E1 occurs at potential GDP. (b) If the equilibrium occurs at an output above potential GDP, then an
inflationary gap exists. The policy solution to an inflationary gap is to shift the aggregate expenditure schedule down
from AE0 to AE1, using policies like tax increases or spending cuts. Then, the new equilibrium E1 occurs at potential
GDP.

What might cause a recessionary gap? Anything that shifts the aggregate expenditure line down is a potential

cause of recession, including a decline in consumption, a rise in savings, a fall in investment, a drop in

government spending or a rise in taxes, or a fall in exports or a rise in imports. Moreover, an economy that is at

equilibrium with a recessionary gap may just stay there and suffer high unemployment for a long time;

remember, the meaning of equilibrium is that there is no particular adjustment of prices or quantities in the

economy to chase the recession away.

The appropriate response to a recessionary gap is for the government to reduce taxes or increase spending so
that the aggregate expenditure function shifts up from AE0 to AE1. When this shift occurs, the new equilibrium
E1 now occurs at potential GDP as shown in Figure B9 (a).

Conversely, Figure B9 (b) shows a situation where the aggregate expenditure schedule (AE0) intersects the
45-degree line above potential GDP. The gap between the level of real GDP at the equilibrium E0 and potential
GDP is called an inflationary gap. The inflationary gap also requires a bit of interpreting. After all, a naïve

reading of the Keynesian cross diagram might suggest that if the aggregate expenditure function is just pushed

up high enough, real GDP can be as large as desired—even doubling or tripling the potential GDP level of the

economy. This implication is clearly wrong. An economy faces some supply-side limits on how much it can

produce at a given time with its existing quantities of workers, physical and human capital, technology, and

market institutions.

The inflationary gap should be interpreted, not as a literal prediction of how large real GDP will be, but as a

statement of how much extra aggregate expenditure is in the economy beyond what is needed to reach

potential GDP. An inflationary gap suggests that because the economy cannot produce enough goods and

services to absorb this level of aggregate expenditures, the spending will instead cause an inflationary increase

in the price level. In this way, even though changes in the price level do not appear explicitly in the Keynesian

cross equation, the notion of inflation is implicit in the concept of the inflationary gap.

The appropriate Keynesian response to an inflationary gap is shown in Figure B9 (b). The original intersection
of aggregate expenditure line AE0 and the 45-degree line occurs at $8,000, which is above the level of potential
GDP at $7,000. If AE0 shifts down to AE1, so that the new equilibrium is at E1, then the economy will be at
potential GDP without pressures for inflationary price increases. The government can achieve a downward

shift in aggregate expenditure by increasing taxes on consumers or firms, or by reducing government
expenditures.

The Multiplier Effect

The Keynesian policy prescription has one final twist. Assume that for a certain economy, the intersection of

the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line is at a GDP of 700, while the level of potential GDP

for this economy is $800. By how much does government spending need to be increased so that the economy

reaches the full employment GDP? The obvious answer might seem to be $800 – $700 = $100; so raise

government spending by $100. But that answer is incorrect. A change of, for example, $100 in government

expenditures will have an effect of more than $100 on the equilibrium level of real GDP. The reason is that a

change in aggregate expenditures circles through the economy: households buy from firms, firms pay workers

and suppliers, workers and suppliers buy goods from other firms, those firms pay their workers and suppliers,

and so on. In this way, the original change in aggregate expenditures is actually spent more than once. This is

called the multiplier effect: An initial increase in spending, cycles repeatedly through the economy and has a

larger impact than the initial dollar amount spent.

564 B • The Expenditure-Output Model

How Does the Multiplier Work?

To understand how the multiplier effect works, return to the example in which the current equilibrium in the

Keynesian cross diagram is a real GDP of $700, or $100 short of the $800 needed to be at full employment,

potential GDP. If the government spends $100 to close this gap, someone in the economy receives that

spending and can treat it as income. Assume that those who receive this income pay 30% in taxes, save 10% of

after-tax income, spend 10% of total income on imports, and then spend the rest on domestically produced

goods and services.

As shown in the calculations in Figure B10 and Table B6, out of the original $100 in government spending, $53

is left to spend on domestically produced goods and services. That $53 which was spent, becomes income to

someone, somewhere in the economy. Those who receive that income also pay 30% in taxes, save 10% of after-

tax income, and spend 10% of total income on imports, as shown in Figure B10, so that an additional $28.09

(that is, 0.53 × $53) is spent in the third round. The people who receive that income then pay taxes, save, and

buy imports, and the amount spent in the fourth round is $14.89 (that is, 0.53 × $28.09).

FIGURE B10 The Multiplier Effect An original increase of government spending of $100 causes a rise in aggregate

expenditure of $100. But that $100 is income to others in the economy, and after they save, pay taxes, and buy

imports, they spend $53 of that $100 in a second round. In turn, that $53 is income to others. Thus, the original

government spending of $100 is multiplied by these cycles of spending, but the impact of each successive cycle

gets smaller and smaller. Given the numbers in this example, the original government spending increase of $100

raises aggregate expenditure by $213; therefore, the multiplier in this example is $213/$100 = 2.13.

TABLE B6 Calculating the Multiplier Effect

Thus, over the first four rounds of aggregate expenditures, the impact of the original increase in government

spending of $100 creates a rise in aggregate expenditures of $100 + $53 + $28.09 + $14.89 = $195.98. Figure

B10 shows these total aggregate expenditures after these first four rounds, and then the figure shows the total

Access for free at openstax.org

B • The Expenditure-Output Model 565

aggregate expenditures after 30 rounds. The additional boost to aggregate expenditures is shrinking in each

round of consumption. After about 10 rounds, the additional increments are very small indeed—nearly

invisible to the naked eye. After 30 rounds, the additional increments in each round are so small that they have

no practical consequence. After 30 rounds, the cumulative value of the initial boost in aggregate expenditure is

approximately $213. Thus, the government spending increase of $100 eventually, after many cycles, produced

an increase of $213 in aggregate expenditure and real GDP. In this example, the multiplier is $213/$100 = 2.13.

Calculating the Multiplier

Fortunately for everyone who is not carrying around a computer with a spreadsheet program to project the

impact of an original increase in expenditures over 20, 50, or 100 rounds of spending, there is a formula for

calculating the multiplier.

The data from Figure B10 and Table B6 is:

• Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS) = 30%

• Tax rate = 10%

• Marginal Propensity to Import (MPI) = 10%

The MPC is equal to 1 – MPS, or 0.7. Therefore, the spending multiplier is:

A change in spending of $100 multiplied by the spending multiplier of 2.13 is equal to a change in GDP of

$213. Not coincidentally, this result is exactly what was calculated in Figure B10 after many rounds of

expenditures cycling through the economy.

The size of the multiplier is determined by what proportion of the marginal dollar of income goes into taxes,

saving, and imports. These three factors are known as “leakages,” because they determine how much demand

“leaks out” in each round of the multiplier effect. If the leakages are relatively small, then each successive

round of the multiplier effect will have larger amounts of demand, and the multiplier will be high. Conversely,

if the leakages are relatively large, then any initial change in demand will diminish more quickly in the second,

third, and later rounds, and the multiplier will be small. Changes in the size of the leakages—a change in the

marginal propensity to save, the tax rate, or the marginal propensity to import—will change the size of the

multiplier.

Calculating Keynesian Policy Interventions

Returning to the original question: How much should government spending be increased to produce a total

increase in real GDP of $100? If the goal is to increase aggregate demand by $100, and the multiplier is 2.13,

then the increase in government spending to achieve that goal would be $100/2.13 = $47. Government

spending of approximately $47, when combined with a multiplier of 2.13 (which is, remember, based on the

specific assumptions about tax, saving, and import rates), produces an overall increase in real GDP of $100,

restoring the economy to potential GDP of $800, as Figure B11 shows.

566 B • The Expenditure-Output Model

FIGURE B11 The Multiplier Effect in an Expenditure-Output Model The power of the multiplier effect is that an

increase in expenditure has a larger increase on the equilibrium output. The increase in expenditure is the vertical
increase from AE0 to AE1. However, the increase in equilibrium output, shown on the horizontal axis, is clearly larger.

The multiplier effect is also visible on the Keynesian cross diagram. Figure B11 shows the example we have

been discussing: a recessionary gap with an equilibrium of $700, potential GDP of $800, the slope of the
aggregate expenditure function (AE0) determined by the assumptions that taxes are 30% of income, savings
are 0.1 of after-tax income, and imports are 0.1 of before-tax income. At AE1, the aggregate expenditure
function is moved up to reach potential GDP.

Now, compare the vertical shift upward in the aggregate expenditure function, which is $47, with the

horizontal shift outward in real GDP, which is $100 (as these numbers were calculated earlier). The rise in real

GDP is more than double the rise in the aggregate expenditure function. (Similarly, if you look back at Figure

B9, you will see that the vertical movements in the aggregate expenditure functions are smaller than the

change in equilibrium output that is produced on the horizontal axis. Again, this is the multiplier effect at

work.) In this way, the power of the multiplier is apparent in the income–expenditure graph, as well as in the

arithmetic calculation.

The multiplier does not just affect government spending, but applies to any change in the economy. Say that

business confidence declines and investment falls off, or that the economy of a leading trading partner slows

down so that export sales decline. These changes will reduce aggregate expenditures, and then will have an

even larger effect on real GDP because of the multiplier effect. Read the following Clear It Up feature to learn

how the multiplier effect can be applied to analyze the economic impact of professional sports.

CLEAR IT UP

How can the multiplier be used to analyze the economic impact of professional sports?
Attracting professional sports teams and building sports stadiums to create jobs and stimulate business growth is

an economic development strategy adopted by many communities throughout the United States. In his recent

article, “Public Financing of Private Sports Stadiums,” James Joyner of Outside the Beltwaylooked at public

financing for NFL teams. Joyner’s findings confirm the earlier work of John Siegfried of Vanderbilt University and

Andrew Zimbalist of Smith College.

Siegfried and Zimbalist used the multiplier to analyze this issue. They considered the amount of taxes paid and

dollars spent locally to see if there was a positive multiplier effect. Since most professional athletes and owners of

sports teams are rich enough to owe a lot of taxes, let’s say that 40% of any marginal income they earn is paid in

Access for free at openstax.org

B • The Expenditure-Output Model 567

taxes. Because athletes are often high earners with short careers, let’s assume that they save one-third of their

after-tax income.

However, many professional athletes do not live year-round in the city in which they play, so let’s say that one-half

of the money that they do spend is spent outside the local area. One can think of spending outside a local economy,

in this example, as the equivalent of imported goods for the national economy.

Now, consider the impact of money spent at local entertainment venues other than professional sports. While the

owners of these other businesses may be comfortably middle-income, few of them are in the economic

stratosphere of professional athletes. Because their incomes are lower, so are their taxes; say that they pay only

35% of their marginal income in taxes. They do not have the same ability, or need, to save as much as professional

athletes, so let’s assume their MPC is just 0.8. Finally, because more of them live locally, they will spend a higher

proportion of their income on local goods—say, 65%.

If these general assumptions hold true, then money spent on professional sports will have less local economic

impact than money spent on other forms of entertainment. For professional athletes, out of a dollar earned, 40

cents goes to taxes, leaving 60 cents. Of that 60 cents, one-third is saved, leaving 40 cents, and half is spent outside

the area, leaving 20 cents. Only 20 cents of each dollar is cycled into the local economy in the first round. For

locally-owned entertainment, out of a dollar earned, 35 cents goes to taxes, leaving 65 cents. Of the rest, 20% is

saved, leaving 52 cents, and of that amount, 65% is spent in the local area, so that 33.8 cents of each dollar of

income is recycled into the local economy.

Siegfried and Zimbalist make the plausible argument that, within their household budgets, people have a fixed

amount to spend on entertainment. If this assumption holds true, then money spent attending professional sports

events is money that was not spent on other entertainment options in a given metropolitan area. Since the multiplier

is lower for professional sports than for other local entertainment options, the arrival of professional sports to a city

would reallocate entertainment spending in a way that causes the local economy to shrink, rather than to grow.

Thus, their findings seem to confirm what Joyner reports and what newspapers across the country are reporting. A

quick Internet search for “economic impact of sports” will yield numerous reports questioning this economic

development strategy.

Multiplier Tradeoffs: Stability versus the Power of Macroeconomic Policy

Is an economy healthier with a high multiplier or a low one? With a high multiplier, any change in aggregate

demand will tend to be substantially magnified, and so the economy will be more unstable. With a low

multiplier, by contrast, changes in aggregate demand will not be multiplied much, so the economy will tend to

be more stable.

However, with a low multiplier, government policy changes in taxes or spending will tend to have less impact

on the equilibrium level of real output. With a higher multiplier, government policies to raise or reduce

aggregate expenditures will have a larger effect. Thus, a low multiplier means a more stable economy, but also

weaker government macroeconomic policy, while a high multiplier means a more volatile economy, but also

an economy in which government macroeconomic policy is more powerful.

Key Concepts and Summary

The expenditure-output model or Keynesian cross diagram shows how the level of aggregate expenditure (on

the vertical axis) varies with the level of economic output (shown on the horizontal axis). Since the value of all

macroeconomic output also represents income to someone somewhere else in the economy, the horizontal

axis can also be interpreted as national income. The equilibrium in the diagram will occur where the aggregate

expenditure line crosses the 45-degree line, which represents the set of points where aggregate expenditure in

the economy is equal to output (or national income). Equilibrium in a Keynesian cross diagram can happen at

potential GDP, or below or above that level.

568 B • The Expenditure-Output Model

The consumption function shows the upward-sloping relationship between national income and consumption.

The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the amount consumed out of an additional dollar of income. A

higher marginal propensity to consume means a steeper consumption function; a lower marginal propensity

to consume means a flatter consumption function. The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the amount saved

out of an additional dollar of income. It is necessarily true that MPC + MPS = 1. The investment function is

drawn as a flat line, showing that investment in the current year does not change with regard to the current

level of national income. However, the investment function will move up and down based on the expected rate

of return in the future. Government spending is drawn as a horizontal line in the Keynesian cross diagram,

because its level is determined by political considerations, not by the current level of income in the economy.

Taxes in the basic Keynesian cross diagram are taken into account by adjusting the consumption function. The

export function is drawn as a horizontal line in the Keynesian cross diagram, because exports do not change as

a result of changes in domestic income, but they move as a result of changes in foreign income, as well as

changes in exchange rates. The import function is drawn as a downward-sloping line, because imports rise

with national income, but imports are a subtraction from aggregate demand. Thus, a higher level of imports

means a lower level of expenditure on domestic goods.

In a Keynesian cross diagram, the equilibrium may be at a level below potential GDP, which is called a

recessionary gap, or at a level above potential GDP, which is called an inflationary gap.

The multiplier effect describes how an initial change in aggregate demand generated several times as much as

cumulative GDP. The size of the spending multiplier is determined by three leakages: spending on savings,

taxes, and imports. The formula for the multiplier is:

An economy with a lower multiplier is more stable—it is less affected either by economic events or by

government policy than an economy with a higher multiplier.

Exercise B3

An economy has the following characteristics:

Y = National income

Taxes = T = 0.25Y

C = Consumption = 400 + 0.85(Y – T)

I = 300

G = 200

X = 500

M = 0.1(Y – T)

Find the equilibrium for this economy. If potential GDP is 3,500, then what change in government spending is

needed to achieve this level? Do this problem two ways. First, plug 3,500 into the equations and solve for G.

Second, calculate the multiplier and figure it out that way.

First, set up the calculation.

Then insert Y for AE and 0.25Y for T.

If full employment is 3,500, then one approach is to plug in 3,500 for Y throughout the equation, but to leave G

as a separate variable.

570 B • The Expenditure-Output Model

A G value of 331.25 is an increase of 131.25 from its original level of 200.

Alternatively, the multiplier is that, out of every dollar spent, 0.25 goes to taxes, leaving 0.75, and out of after-

tax income, 0.15 goes to savings and 0.1 to imports. Because (0.75)(0.15) = 0.1125 and (0.75)(0.1) = 0.075, this

means that out of every dollar spent: 1 –0.25 –0.1125 –0.075 = 0.5625.

Thus, using the formula, the multiplier is:

To increase equilibrium GDP by 300, it will take a boost of 300/2.2837, which again works out to 131.25.

Exercise B4

Table B7 represents the data behind a Keynesian cross diagram. Assume that the tax rate is 0.4 of national

B • The Expenditure-Output Model 571

Explain how the multiplier works. Use an MPC of 80% in an example.

The multiplier refers to how many times a dollar will turnover in the economy. It is based on the Marginal

Propensity to Consume (MPC) which tells how much of every dollar received will be spent. If the MPC is 80%

then this means that out of every one dollar received by a consumer, $0.80 will be spent. This $0.80 is received

by another person. In turn, 80% of the $0.80 received, or $0.64, will be spent, and so on. The impact of the

multiplier is diluted when the effect of taxes and expenditure on imports is considered. To derive the

multiplier, take the 1/1 – F; where F is equal to percent of savings, taxes, and expenditures on imports.

ANSWER KEY

Chapter 1

1. Scarcity means human wants for goods and services exceed the available supply. Supply is limited

because resources are limited. Demand, however, is virtually unlimited. Whatever the supply, it seems

human nature to want more.

2. 100 people / 10 people per ham = a maximum of 10 hams per month if all residents produce ham. Since

consumption is limited by production, the maximum number of hams residents could consume per

month is 10.

3. She is very productive at her consulting job, but not very productive growing vegetables. Time spent

consulting would produce far more income than it what she could save growing her vegetables using the

same amount of time. So on purely economic grounds, it makes more sense for her to maximize her

income by applying her labor to what she does best (i.e. specialization of labor).

4. The engineer is better at computer science than at painting. Thus, his time is better spent working for pay

at his job and paying a painter to paint his house. Of course, this assumes he does not paint his house for

fun!

5. There are many physical systems that would work, for example, the study of planets (micro) in the solar

system (macro), or solar systems (micro) in the galaxy (macro).

6. Draw a box outside the original circular flow to represent the foreign country. Draw an arrow from the

foreign country to firms, to represents imports. Draw an arrow in the reverse direction representing

payments for imports. Draw an arrow from firms to the foreign country to represent exports. Draw an

arrow in the reverse direction to represent payments for imports.

7. There are many such problems. Consider the AIDS epidemic. Why are so few AIDS patients in Africa and

Southeast Asia treated with the same drugs that are effective in the United States and Europe? It is

because neither those patients nor the countries in which they live have the resources to purchase the

same drugs.

8. Public enterprise means the factors of production (resources and businesses) are owned and operated by

the government.

9. The United States is a large country economically speaking, so it has less need to trade internationally

than the other countries mentioned. (This is the same reason that France and Italy have lower ratios than

Belgium or Sweden.) One additional reason is that each of the other countries is a member of the European

Union, where trade between members occurs without barriers to trade, like tariffs and quotas.

Chapter 2

1. The opportunity cost of bus tickets is the number of burgers that must be given up to obtain one more bus

ticket. Originally, when the price of bus tickets was 50 cents per trip, this opportunity cost was 0.50/2 = .25

burgers. The reason for this is that at the original prices, one burger ($2) costs the same as four bus tickets

($0.50), so the opportunity cost of a burger is four bus tickets, and the opportunity cost of a bus ticket is .25

burgers (the inverse of the opportunity cost of a burger). With the new, higher price of bus tickets, the

opportunity cost rises to $1/$2 or 0.50 burgers. You can see this graphically since the slope of the new

budget constraint is steeper than the original one. If Alphonso spends all of his budget on burgers, the

higher price of bus tickets has no impact so the vertical intercept of the budget constraint is the same. If he

spends his entire budget on bus tickets, he can now afford only half as many, so the horizontal intercept is

half as much. In short, the budget constraint rotates clockwise around the vertical intercept, steepening as

it goes and the opportunity cost of bus tickets increases.

574

2. Because of the improvement in technology, the vertical intercept of the PPF would be at a higher level of

healthcare. In other words, the PPF would rotate clockwise around the horizontal intercept. This would

make the PPF steeper, corresponding to an increase in the opportunity cost of education, since resources

devoted to education would now mean forgoing a greater quantity of healthcare.

3. No. Allocative efficiency requires productive efficiency, because it pertains to choices along the production

possibilities frontier.

4. Both the budget constraint and the PPF show the constraint that each operates under. Both show a tradeoff

between having more of one good but less of the other. Both show the opportunity cost graphically as the

slope of the constraint (budget or PPF).

5. When individuals compare cost per unit in the grocery store, or characteristics of one product versus

another, they are behaving approximately like the model describes.

6. Since an op-ed makes a case for what should be, it is considered normative.

7. Assuming that the study is not taking an explicit position about whether soft drink consumption is good or

bad, but just reporting the science, it would be considered positive.

Chapter 3

1. Since $1.60 per gallon is above the equilibrium price, the quantity demanded would be lower at 550

gallons and the quantity supplied would be higher at 640 gallons. (These results are due to the laws of

demand and supply, respectively.) The outcome of lower Qd and higher Qs would be a surplus in the

gasoline market of 640 – 550 = 90 gallons.

2. To make it easier to analyze complex problems. Ceteris paribusallows you to look at the effect of one factor

at a time on what it is you are trying to analyze. When you have analyzed all the factors individually, you

add the results together to get the final answer.

3. a. An improvement in technology that reduces the cost of production will cause an increase in supply.

Alternatively, you can think of this as a reduction in price necessary for firms to supply any quantity.

Either way, this can be shown as a rightward (or downward) shift in the supply curve.

b. An improvement in product quality is treated as an increase in tastes or preferences, meaning

consumers demand more paint at any price level, so demand increases or shifts to the right. If this

seems counterintuitive, note that demand in the future for the longer-lasting paint will fall, since

consumers are essentially shifting demand from the future to the present.

c. An increase in need causes an increase in demand or a rightward shift in the demand curve.

d. Factory damage means that firms are unable to supply as much in the present. Technically, this is an

increase in the cost of production. Either way you look at it, the supply curve shifts to the left.

4. a. More fuel-efficient cars means there is less need for gasoline. This causes a leftward shift in the

demand for gasoline and thus oil. Since the demand curve is shifting down the supply curve, the

equilibrium price and quantity both fall.

b. Cold weather increases the need for heating oil. This causes a rightward shift in the demand for

heating oil and thus oil. Since the demand curve is shifting up the supply curve, the equilibrium price

and quantity both rise.

c. A discovery of new oil will make oil more abundant. This can be shown as a rightward shift in the

Access for free at openstax.org

575

supply curve, which will cause a decrease in the equilibrium price along with an increase in the

equilibrium quantity. (The supply curve shifts down the demand curve so price and quantity follow

the law of demand. If price goes down, then the quantity goes up.)

d. When an economy slows down, it produces less output and demands less input, including energy,

which is used in the production of virtually everything. A decrease in demand for energy will be

reflected as a decrease in the demand for oil, or a leftward shift in demand for oil. Since the demand

curve is shifting down the supply curve, both the equilibrium price and quantity of oil will fall.

e. Disruption of oil pumping will reduce the supply of oil. This leftward shift in the supply curve will

show a movement up the demand curve, resulting in an increase in the equilibrium price of oil and a

decrease in the equilibrium quantity.

f.

Increased insulation will decrease the demand for heating. This leftward shift in the demand for oil

causes a movement down the supply curve, resulting in a decrease in the equilibrium price and

quantity of oil.

g. Solar energy is a substitute for oil-based energy. So if solar energy becomes cheaper, the demand for

oil will decrease as consumers switch from oil to solar. The decrease in demand for oil will be shown

as a leftward shift in the demand curve. As the demand curve shifts down the supply curve, both

equilibrium price and quantity for oil will fall.

h. A new, popular kind of plastic will increase the demand for oil. The increase in demand will be shown

as a rightward shift in demand, raising the equilibrium price and quantity of oil.

5. Step 1. Draw the graph with the initial supply and demand curves. Label the initial equilibrium price and

quantity.

Step 2. Did the economic event affect supply or demand? Jet fuel is a cost of producing air travel, so an

increase in jet fuel price affects supply.

Step 3. An increase in the price of jet fuel caused an increase in the cost of air travel. We show this as an

upward or leftward shift in supply.

Step 4. A leftward shift in supply causes a movement up the demand curve, increasing the equilibrium

price of air travel and decreasing the equilibrium quantity.

6. Step 1. Draw the graph with the initial supply and demand curves. Label the initial equilibrium price and

quantity.

Step 2. Did the economic event affect supply or demand? A tariff is treated like a cost of production, so this

affects supply.

Step 3. A tariff reduction is equivalent to a decrease in the cost of production, which we can show as a

rightward (or downward) shift in supply.

Step 4. A rightward shift in supply causes a movement down the demand curve, lowering the equilibrium

price and raising the equilibrium quantity.

7. A price ceiling (which is below the equilibrium price) will cause the quantity demanded to rise and the

quantity supplied to fall. This is why a price ceiling creates a shortage.

8. A price ceiling is just a legal restriction. Equilibrium is an economic condition. People may or may not

obey the price ceiling, so the actual price may be at or above the price ceiling, but the price ceiling does not

change the equilibrium price.

9. A price ceiling is a legal maximum price, but a price floor is a legal minimum price and, consequently, it

would leave room for the price to rise to its equilibrium level. In other words, a price floor below

equilibrium will not be binding and will have no effect.

10. Assuming that people obey the price ceiling, the market price will be below equilibrium, which means that

Qd will be more than Qs. Buyers can only buy what is offered for sale, so the number of transactions will

fall to Qs. This is easy to see graphically. By analogous reasoning, with a price floor the market price will be

above the equilibrium price, so Qd will be less than Qs. Since the limit on transactions here is demand, the

number of transactions will fall to Qd. Note that because both price floors and price ceilings reduce the

number of transactions, social surplus is less.

576

11. Because the losses to consumers are greater than the benefits to producers, so the net effect is negative.

Since the lost consumer surplus is greater than the additional producer surplus, social surplus falls.

Chapter 4

1. Changes in the wage rate (the price of labor) cause a movement along the demand curve. A change in

anything else that affects demand for labor (e.g., changes in output, changes in the production process that

use more or less labor, government regulation) causes a shift in the demand curve.

2. Changes in the wage rate (the price of labor) cause a movement along the supply curve. A change in

anything else that affects supply of labor (e.g., changes in how desirable the job is perceived to be,

government policy to promote training in the field) causes a shift in the supply curve.

3. Since a living wage is a suggested minimum wage, it acts like a price floor (assuming, of course, that it is

followed). If the living wage is binding, it will cause an excess supply of labor at that wage rate.

4. Changes in the interest rate (i.e., the price of financial capital) cause a movement along the demand curve.

A change in anything else (non-price variable) that affects demand for financial capital (e.g., changes in

confidence about the future, changes in needs for borrowing) would shift the demand curve.

5. Changes in the interest rate (i.e., the price of financial capital) cause a movement along the supply curve. A

change in anything else that affects the supply of financial capital (a non-price variable) such as income or

future needs would shift the supply curve.

6. If market interest rates stay in their normal range, an interest rate limit of 35% would not be binding. If the

equilibrium interest rate rose above 35%, the interest rate would be capped at that rate, and the quantity of

loans would be lower than the equilibrium quantity, causing a shortage of loans.

7. b and c will lead to a fall in interest rates. At a lower demand, lenders will not be able to charge as much,

and with more available lenders, competition for borrowers will drive rates down.

8. a and c will increase the quantity of loans. More people who want to borrow will result in more loans being

given, as will more people who want to lend.

9. A price floor prevents a price from falling below a certain level, but has no effect on prices above that level. It

will have its biggest effect in creating excess supply (as measured by the entire area inside the dotted lines on

the graph, from D to S) if it is substantially above the equilibrium price. This is illustrated in the following

figure.

It will have a lesser effect if it is slightly above the equilibrium price. This is illustrated in the next figure.

577

It will have no effect if it is set either slightly or substantially below the equilibrium price, since an equilibrium

price above a price floor will not be affected by that price floor. The following figure illustrates these situations.

10. A price ceiling prevents a price from rising above a certain level, but has no effect on prices below that level. It

will have its biggest effect in creating excess demand if it is substantially below the equilibrium price. The

following figure illustrates these situations.

578

When the price ceiling is set substantially or slightly above the equilibrium price, it will have no effect on

creating excess demand. The following figure illustrates these situations.

11. Neither. A shift in demand or supply means that at every price, either a greater or a lower quantity is

demanded or supplied. A price floor does not shift a demand curve or a supply curve. However, if the price

floor is set above the equilibrium, it will cause the quantity supplied on the supply curve to be greater than

the quantity demanded on the demand curve, leading to excess supply.

12. Neither. A shift in demand or supply means that at every price, either a greater or a lower quantity is

demanded or supplied. A price ceiling does not shift a demand curve or a supply curve. However, if the

price ceiling is set below the equilibrium, it will cause the quantity demanded on the demand curve to be

greater than the quantity supplied on the supply curve, leading to excess demand.

1. From point B to point C, price rises from $70 to $80, and Qd decreases from 2,800 to 2,600. So:

The demand curve is inelastic in this area; that is, its elasticity value is less than one.

Answer from Point D to point E:

The demand curve is inelastic in this area; that is, its elasticity value is less than one.

Answer from Point G to point H:

The demand curve is elastic in this interval.

2. From point J to point K, price rises from $8 to $9, and quantity rises from 50 to 70. So:

The supply curve is elastic in this area; that is, its elasticity value is greater than one.

From point L to point M, the price rises from $10 to $11, while the Qs rises from 80 to 88:

580

The supply curve has unitary elasticity in this area.

From point N to point P, the price rises from $12 to $13, and Qs rises from 95 to 100:

The supply curve is inelastic in this region of the supply curve.

3. The demand curve with constant unitary elasticity is concave because the absolute value of declines in

price are not identical. The left side of the curve starts with high prices, and then price falls by smaller

amounts as it goes down toward the right side. This results in a slope of demand that is steeper on the left

but flatter on the right, creating a curved, concave shape.

4. The constant unitary elasticity is a straight line because the curve slopes upward and both price and

quantity are increasing proportionally.

5. Carmakers can pass this cost along to consumers if the demand for these cars is inelastic. If the demand

for these cars is elastic, then the manufacturer must pay for the equipment.

6. If the elasticity is 1.4 at current prices, you would advise the company to lower its price on the product,

since a decrease in price will be offset by the increase in the amount of the drug sold. If the elasticity were

0.6, then you would advise the company to increase its price. Increases in price will offset the decrease in
number of units sold, but increase your total revenue. If elasticity is 1, the total revenue is already

maximized, and you would advise that the company maintain its current price level.

7. The percentage change in quantity supplied as a result of a given percentage change in the price of

gasoline.

8.

In this example, bread is an inferior good because its consumption falls as income rises.

9. The formula for cross-price elasticity is % change in Qd for apples / % change in P of oranges. Multiplying

Access for free at openstax.org

581

both sides by % change in P of oranges yields:

% change in Qd for apples = cross-price elasticity X% change in P of oranges

= 0.4 × (–3%) = –1.2%, or a 1.2 % decrease in demand for apples.

Chapter 6

1. GDP is C + I + G + (X – M). GDP = $2,000 billion + $50 billion + $1,000 billion + ($20 billion – $40 billion) =

$3,030

2. a. Hospital stays are part of GDP.

b. Changes in life expectancy are not market transactions and not part of GDP.

c. Child care that is paid for is part of GDP.

d.

If Grandma gets paid and reports this as income, it is part of GDP, otherwise not.

e. A used car is not produced this year, so it is not part of GDP.

f. A new car is part of GDP.

g. Variety does not count in GDP, where the cheese could all be cheddar.

h. The iron is not counted because it is an intermediate good.

3. From 1980 to 1990, real GDP grew by (8,225.0 – 5,926.5) / (5,926.5) = 39%. Over the same period, prices

increased by (72.7 – 48.3) / (48.3/100) = 51%. So about 57% of the growth 51 / (51 + 39) was inflation, and

the remainder: 39 / (51 + 39) = 43% was growth in real GDP.

4. Two other major recessions are visible in the figure as slight dips: those of 1973–1975, and 1981–1982.

Two other recessions appear in the figure as a flattening of the path of real GDP. These were in 1990–1991

and 2001.

5. 11 recessions in approximately 70 years averages about one recession every six years.

6. The table lists the “Months of Contraction” for each recession. Averaging these figures for the post-WWII

recessions gives an average duration of 11 months, or slightly less than a year.

7. The table lists the “Months of Expansion.” Averaging these figures for the post-WWII expansions gives an

average expansion of 60.5 months, or more than five years.

8. Yes. The answer to both questions depends on whether GDP is growing faster or slower than population. If

population grows faster than GDP, GDP increases, while GDP per capita decreases. If GDP falls, but

population falls faster, then GDP decreases, while GDP per capita increases.

9. Start with Central African Republic’s GDP measured in francs. Divide it by the exchange rate to convert to

U.S. dollars, and then divide by population to obtain the per capita figure. That is, 1,107,689 million francs

/ 284.681 francs per dollar / 4.862 million people = $800.28 GDP per capita.

10. a. A dirtier environment would reduce the broad standard of living, but not be counted in GDP, so a rise

in GDP would overstate the standard of living.

b. A lower crime rate would raise the broad standard of living, but not be counted directly in GDP, and so

a rise in GDP would understate the standard of living.

c. A greater variety of goods would raise the broad standard of living, but not be counted directly in GDP,

and so a rise in GDP would understate the rise in the standard of living.

d. A decline in infant mortality would raise the broad standard of living, but not be counted directly in

GDP, and so a rise in GDP would understate the rise in the standard of living.

Chapter 7

1. The Industrial Revolution refers to the widespread use of power-driven machinery and the economic and

social changes that resulted in the first half of the 1800s. Ingenious machines—the steam engine, the

power loom, and the steam locomotive—performed tasks that would have taken vast numbers of workers

to do. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain, and soon spread to the United States, Germany,

and other countries.

2. Property rights are the rights of individuals and firms to own property and use it as they see fit.

582

Contractual rights are based on property rights and they allow individuals to enter into agreements with

others regarding the use of their property providing recourse through the legal system in the event of

noncompliance. Economic growth occurs when the standard of living increases in an economy, which

occurs when output is increasing and incomes are rising. For this to happen, societies must create a legal

environment that gives individuals the ability to use their property to their fullest and highest use,

including the right to trade or sell that property. Without a legal system that enforces contracts, people

would not be likely to enter into contracts for current or future services because of the risk of non-

payment. This would make it difficult to transact business and would slow economic growth.

3. Yes. Since productivity is output per unit of input, we can measure productivity using GDP (output) per

worker (input).

4. In 20 years the United States will have an income of 10,000 × (1 + 0.01)20 = $12,201.90, and South Korea
will have an income of 10,000 × (1 + 0.04)20 = $21,911.23. South Korea has grown by a multiple of 2.1 and
the United States by a multiple of 1.2.

5. Capital deepening and technology are important. What seems to be more important is how they are

combined.

6. Government can contribute to economic growth by investing in human capital through the education

system, building a strong physical infrastructure for transportation and commerce, increasing investment

by lowering capital gains taxes, creating special economic zones that allow for reduced tariffs, and

investing in research and development.

7. Public education, low investment taxes, funding for infrastructure projects, special economic zones

8. A good way to think about this is how a runner who has fallen behind in a race feels psychologically and

physically as he catches up. Playing catch-up can be more taxing than maintaining one’s position at the

head of the pack.

9. a. No. Capital deepening refers to an increase in the amount of capital per person in an economy. A

decrease in investment by firms will actually cause the opposite of capital deepening (since the

population will grow over time).

b. There is no direct connection between an increase in international trade and capital deepening. One

could imagine particular scenarios where trade could lead to capital deepening (for example, if

international capital inflows—which are the counterpart to increasing the trade deficit—lead to an

increase in physical capital investment), but in general, no.

c. Yes. Capital deepening refers to an increase in either physical capital or human capital per person.

Continuing education or any time of lifelong learning adds to human capital and thus creates capital

deepening.

10. The advantages of backwardness include faster growth rates because of the process of convergence, as

well as the ability to adopt new technologies that were developed first in the “leader” countries. While

being “backward” is not inherently a good thing, Gerschenkron stressed that there are certain advantages

which aid countries trying to “catch up.”

11. Capital deepening, by definition, should lead to diminished returns because you're investing more and

more but using the same methods of production, leading to the marginal productivity declining. This is

shown on a production function as a movement along the curve. Improvements in technology should not

lead to diminished returns because you are finding new and more efficient ways of using the same

amount of capital. This can be illustrated as a shift upward of the production function curve.

12. In high-income economies, diminishing returns to investments in physical and human capital may not

apply because many high-income economies have developed economic and political institutions that

provide a healthy economic climate for an ongoing stream of technological innovations. Continuous

technological innovation can counterbalance diminishing returns to investments in human and physical

capital. These two factors have the added effect of making additional technological advances even easier

for these countries.

As a result, productivity growth from new advances in technology will not increase at a diminishing rate

Access for free at openstax.org

583

or otherwise slow down because the new methods of production will be adopted relatively quickly and

easily, at very low marginal cost.

Chapter 8

1. The population is divided into those “in the labor force” and those “not in the labor force.” Thus, the

number of adults not in the labor force is 237.8 – 153.9 = 83.9 million. Since the labor force is divided into

employed persons and unemployed persons, the number of unemployed persons is 153.9 – 139.1 = 14.8

million. Thus, the adult population has the following proportions:

• 139.1/237.8 = 58.5% employed persons

• 14.8/237.8 = 6.2% unemployed persons

• 83.9/237.8 = 35.3% persons out of the labor force

2. The unemployment rate is defined as the number of unemployed persons as a percentage of the labor

force or 14.8/153.9 = 9.6%. This is higher than the February 2015 unemployment rate, computed earlier,

of 5.5%.

3. Over the long term, the U.S. unemployment rate has remained basically the same level.

4. a. Non-White people

b. The young

c. High school graduates

5. Because of the influx of women into the labor market, the supply of labor shifts to the right. Since wages

are sticky downward, the increased supply of labor causes an increase in people looking for jobs (Qs), but

no change in the number of jobs available (Qe). As a result, unemployment increases by the amount of the

increase in the labor supply. This can be seen in the following figure.

Over time, as labor demand grows, the unemployment will decline and eventually wages will begin to

increase again. But this increase in labor demand goes beyond the scope of this problem.

6. The increase in labor supply was a social demographic trend—it was not caused by the economy falling

into a recession. Therefore, the influx of women into the work force increased the natural rate of

unemployment.

7. New entrants to the labor force, whether from college or otherwise, are counted as frictionally unemployed

until they find a job.

Chapter 9

1. To compute the amount spent on each fruit in each year, you multiply the quantity of each fruit by the

price.

584

• 10 apples × 50 cents each = $5.00 spent on apples in 2001.

• 12 bananas × 20 cents each = $2.40 spent on bananas in 2001.

• 2 bunches of grapes at 65 cents each = $1.30 spent on grapes in 2001.

• 1 pint of raspberries at $2 each = $2.00 spent on raspberries in 2001.

Adding up the amounts gives you the total cost of the fruit basket. The total cost of the fruit basket in 2001

was $5.00 + $2.40 + $1.30 + $2.00 = $10.70. The total costs for all the years are shown in the following

table.

2001

2002

2003

2004

$10.70 $13.80 $15.35 $16.31

2. If 2003 is the base year, then the index number has a value of 100 in 2003. To transform the cost of a fruit

basket each year, we divide each year’s value by $15.35, the value of the base year, and then multiply the

result by 100. The price index is shown in the following table.

2001

2002

2003

2004

69.71 89.90 100.00 106.3

Note that the base year has a value of 100; years before the base year have values less than 100; and years

after have values more than 100.

3. The inflation rate is calculated as the percentage change in the price index from year to year. For example,

the inflation rate between 2001 and 2002 is (89.90 – 69.71) / 69.71 = 0.2137 = 28.96%. The inflation rates

for all the years are shown in the last row of the following table, which includes the two previous answers.

The rise in cost of living is calculated as the percentage increase:

(2244 – 2120) / 2120 = 0.0585 = 5.85%.

5. Since the CPI measures the prices of the goods and services purchased by the typical urban consumer, it

measures the prices of things that people buy with their paycheck. For that reason, the CPI would be the

best price index to use for this purpose.

6. The PPI is subject to those biases for essentially the same reasons as the CPI is. The GDP deflator picks up

prices of what is actually purchased that year, so there are no biases. That is the advantage of using the

GDP deflator over the CPI.

7. The calculator requires you to input three numbers:

• The first year, in this case the year of your birth

• The amount of money you would want to translate in terms of its purchasing power

• The last year—now or the most recent year the calculator will accept

My birth year is 1955. The amount is $1. The year 2012 is currently the latest year the calculator will

accept. The simple purchasing power calculator shows that $1 of purchases in 1955 would cost $8.57 in

2012. The website also explains how the true answer is more complicated than that shown by the simple

purchasing power calculator.

8. The state government would benefit because it would repay the loan in less valuable dollars than it

borrowed. Plus, tax revenues for the state government would increase because of the inflation.

9. Higher inflation reduces real interest rates on fixed rate mortgages. Because ARMs can be adjusted, higher

inflation leads to higher interest rates on ARMs.

10. Because the mortgage has an adjustable rate, the rate should fall by 3%, the same as inflation, to keep the

real interest rate the same.

Chapter 10

1. The stock and bond values will not show up in the current account. However, the dividends from the stocks

and the interest from the bonds show up as an import to income in the current account.

2. It becomes more negative as imports, which are a negative to the current account, are growing faster than

exports, which are a positive.

3. a. Money flows out of the Mexican economy.

b. Money flows into the Mexican economy.

c. Money flows out of the Mexican economy.

4. GDP is a dollar value of all production of goods and services. Exports are produced domestically but

shipped abroad. The percent ratio of exports to GDP gives us an idea of how important exports are to the

national economy out of all goods and services produced. For example, exports represent only 14% of U.S.

GDP, but 50% of Germany’s GDP

5. Divide $542 billion by $1,800 billion.

6. Divide –$400 billion by $16,800 billion.

586

7. The trade balance is the difference between exports and imports. The current account balance includes

this number (whether it is a trade balance or a trade surplus), but also includes international flows of

money from global investments.

8. a. An export sale to Germany involves a financial flow from Germany to the U.S. economy.

b. The issue here is not U.S. investments in Brazil, but the return paid on those investments, which

involves a financial flow from the Brazilian economy to the U.S. economy.

c. Foreign aid from the United States to Egypt is a financial flow from the United States to Egypt.

d.

Importing oil from the Russian Federation means a flow of financial payments from the U.S. economy

to the Russian Federation.

e. Japanese investors buying U.S. real estate is a financial flow from Japan to the U.S. economy.

9. The top portion tracks the flow of exports and imports and the payments for those. The bottom portion is

looking at international financial investments and the outflow and inflow of monies from those

investments. These investments can include investments in stocks and bonds or real estate abroad, as well

as international borrowing and lending.

10. If more monies are flowing out of the country (for example, to pay for imports) it will make the current

account more negative or less positive, and if more monies are flowing into the country, it will make the

current account less negative or more positive.

11. Write out the national savings and investment identity for the situation of the economy implied by this

question:

If domestic savings increases and nothing else changes, then the trade deficit will fall. In effect, the

economy would be relying more on domestic capital and less on foreign capital. If the government starts

borrowing instead of saving, then the trade deficit must rise. In effect, the government is no longer

providing savings and so, if nothing else is to change, more investment funds must arrive from abroad. If

the rate of domestic investment surges, then, ceteris paribus, the trade deficit must also rise, to provide

the extra capital. The ceteris paribus—or “other things being equal”—assumption is important here. In all

of these situations, there is no reason to expect in the real world that the original change will affect only, or

primarily, the trade deficit. The identity only says that something will adjust—it does not specify what.

12. The government is saving rather than borrowing. The supply of savings, whether private or public, is on

the left side of the identity.

13. A trade deficit is determined by a country’s level of private and public savings and the amount of domestic

investment.

14. The trade deficit must increase. To put it another way, this increase in investment must be financed by an

inflow of financial capital from abroad.

15. Incomes fall during a recession, and consumers buy fewer good, including imports.

16. A booming economy will increase the demand for goods in general, so import sales will increase. If our

trading partners’ economies are doing well, they will buy more of our products and so U.S. exports will

increase.

17. a.

Increased federal spending on Medicare may not increase productivity, so a budget deficit is not

justified.

b.

Increased spending on education will increase productivity and foster greater economic growth, so a

budget deficit is justified.

c.

Increased spending on the space program may not increase productivity, so a budget deficit is not

justified.

d.

Increased spending on airports and air traffic control will increase productivity and foster greater

economic growth, so a budget deficit is justified.

18. Foreign investors worried about repayment so they began to pull money out of these countries. The money

can be pulled out of stock and bond markets, real estate, and banks.

19. A rapidly growing trade surplus could result from a number of factors, so you would not want to be too

quick to assume a specific cause. However, if the choice is between whether the economy is in recession or

growing rapidly, the answer would have to be recession. In a recession, demand for all goods, including

imports, has declined; however, demand for exports from other countries has not necessarily altered

much, so the result is a larger trade surplus.

20. Germany has a higher level of trade than the United States. The United States has a large domestic

economy so it has a large volume of internal trade.

21. a. A large economy tends to have lower levels of international trade, because it can do more of its trade

internally, but this has little impact on its trade imbalance.

b. An imbalance between domestic physical investment and domestic saving (including government and

private saving) will always lead to a trade imbalance, but has little to do with the level of trade.

c. Many large trading partners nearby geographically increases the level of trade, but has little impact

one way or the other on a trade imbalance.

d. The answer here is not obvious. An especially large budget deficit means a large demand for financial

capital which, according to the national saving and investment identity, makes it somewhat more

likely that there will be a need for an inflow of foreign capital, which means a trade deficit.

e. A strong tradition of discouraging trade certainly reduces the level of trade. However, it does not

necessarily say much about the balance of trade, since this is determined by both imports and

exports, and by national levels of physical investment and savings.

Chapter 11

1. In order to supply goods, suppliers must employ workers, whose incomes increase as a result of their

labor. They use this additional income to demand goods of an equivalent value to those they supply.

2. When consumers demand more goods than are available on the market, prices are driven higher and the

additional opportunities for profit induce more suppliers to enter the market, producing an equivalent

amount to that which is demanded.

3. Higher input prices make output less profitable, decreasing the desired supply. This is shown graphically

as a leftward shift in the AS curve.

4. Equilibrium occurs at the level of GDP where AD = AS. Insufficient aggregate demand could explain why

the equilibrium occurs at a level of GDP less than potential. A decrease (or leftward shift) in aggregate

supply could be another reason.

5. Equilibrium real GDP will decrease and the price level will increase.

6. Given the assumptions made here, the cuts in R&D funding should reduce productivity growth. The model

would show this as a leftward shift in the SRAS curve, leading to a lower equilibrium GDP and a higher

price level.

7. An increase in the value of the stock market would make individuals feel wealthier and thus more

confident about their economic situation. This would likely cause an increase in consumer confidence

leading to an increase in consumer spending, shifting the AD curve to the right. The result would be an

increase in the equilibrium level of GDP and an increase in the price level.

8. Since imports depend on GDP, if Mexico goes into recession, its GDP declines and so do its imports. This

decline in our exports can be shown as a leftward shift in AD, leading to a decrease in our GDP and price

level.

9. Tax cuts increase consumer and investment spending, depending on where the tax cuts are targeted. This

would shift AD to the right, so if the tax cuts occurred when the economy was in recession (and GDP was

less than potential), the tax cuts would increase GDP and “lead the economy out of recession.”

10. A negative report on home prices would make consumers feel like the value of their homes, which for

most Americans is a major portion of their wealth, has declined. A negative report on consumer

588

confidence would make consumers feel pessimistic about the future. Both of these would likely reduce

consumer spending, shifting AD to the left, reducing GDP and the price level. A positive report on the

home price index or consumer confidence would do the opposite.

11. A smaller labor force would be reflected in a leftward shift in AS, leading to a lower equilibrium level of

GDP and higher price level.

12. Higher EU growth would increase demand for U.S. exports, reducing our trade deficit. The increased

demand for exports would show up as a rightward shift in AD, causing GDP to rise (and the price level to

rise as well). Higher GDP would require more jobs to fulfill, so U.S. employment would also rise.

13. Expansionary monetary policy shifts AD to the right. A continuing expansionary policy would cause larger

and larger shifts (given the parameters of this problem). The result would be an increase in GDP and

employment (a decrease in unemployment) and higher prices until potential output was reached. After

that point, the expansionary policy would simply cause inflation.

14. Since the SRAS curve is vertical in the neoclassical zone, unless the economy is bordering the

intermediate zone, a decrease in AS will cause a decrease in the price level, but no effect on real economic

activity (for example, real GDP or employment).

15. Because the SRAS curve is horizontal in the Keynesian zone, a decrease in AD should depress real

economic activity but have no effect on prices.

Chapter 12

1. a. An increase in home values will increase consumption spending (due to increased wealth). AD will

shift to the right and may cause inflation if it goes beyond potential GDP.

b. Rapid growth by a major trading partner will increase demand for exports. AD will shift to the right

and may cause inflation if it goes beyond potential GDP.

c.

Increased profit opportunities will increase business investment. AD will shift to the right and may

cause inflation if it goes beyond potential GDP.

d. Higher interest rates reduce investment spending. AD will shift to the left and may cause recession if it

falls below potential GDP.

e. Demand for cheaper imports increases, reducing demand for domestic products. AD will shift to the

left and may be recessionary.

2. a. A tax increase on consumer income will cause consumption to fall, pushing the AD curve left, and is a

possible solution to inflation.

b. A surge in military spending is an increase in government spending. This will cause the AD curve to

shift to the right. If real GDP is less than potential GDP, then this spending would pull the economy out

of a recession. If real GDP is to the right of potential GDP, then the AD curve will shift farther to the

right and military spending will be inflationary.

c. A tax cut focused on business investment will shift AD to the right. If the original macroeconomic

equilibrium is below potential GDP, then this policy can help move an economy out of a recession.

d. Government spending on healthcare will cause the AD curve to shift to the right. If real GDP is less

than potential GDP, then this spending would pull the economy out of a recession. If real GDP is to th

right of potential GDP, then the AD curve will shift farther to the right and healthcare spending will be

inflationary.

3. An inflationary gap is the result of an increase in aggregate demand when the economy is at potential

output. Since the AS curve is vertical at potential GDP, any increase in AD will lead to a higher price level
(i.e. inflation) but no higher real GDP. This is easy to see if you draw AD1 to the right of AD0.

4. A decrease in government spending will shift AD to the left.

5. A decrease in energy prices, a positive supply shock, would cause the AS curve to shift out to the right,

yielding more real GDP at a lower price level. This would shift the Phillips curve down toward the origin,

meaning the economy would experience lower unemployment and a lower rate of inflation.

6. Keynesian economics does not require microeconomic price controls of any sort. It is true that many

Keynesian economic prescriptions were for the government to influence the total amount of aggregate

demand in the economy, often through government spending and tax cuts.

7. The three problems center on government’s ability to estimate potential GDP, decide whether to influence

aggregate demand through tax changes or changes in government spending, and the lag time that occurs

as Congress and the President attempt to pass legislation.

Chapter 13

1. No, this statement is false. It would be more accurate to say that rational expectations seek to predict the

future as accurately as possible, using all of past experience as a guide. Adaptive expectations are largely

backward looking; that is, they adapt as experience accumulates, but without attempting to look forward.

2. An unemployment rate of zero percent is presumably well below the rate that is consistent with potential

GDP and with the natural rate of unemployment. As a result, this policy would be attempting to push AD

out to the right.

In the short run, it is possible to have unemployment slightly below the natural rate for a time, at a price of
higher inflation, as shown by the movement from E0 to E1 along the short-run AS curve. However, over
time the extremely low unemployment rates will tend to cause wages to be bid up, and shift the short-run

AS curve back to the left. The result would be a higher price level, but an economy still at potential GDP

and the natural rate of unemployment, as determined by the long-run AS curve. If the government

continues this policy, it will continually be pushing the price level higher and higher, but it will not be able

to achieve its goal of zero percent unemployment, because that goal is inconsistent with market forces.

3. The statement is accurate. Rational expectations can be thought of as a version of neoclassical economics

because it argues that potential GDP and the rate of unemployment are shaped by market forces as wages

and prices adjust. However, it is an “extreme” version because it argues that this adjustment takes place

very quickly. Other theories, like adaptive expectations, suggest that adjustment to the neoclassical

outcome takes a few years.

4. The short-term Keynesian model is built on the importance of aggregate demand as a cause of business

cycles and a degree of wage and price rigidity, and thus does a sound job of explaining many recessions

and why cyclical unemployment rises and falls. The neoclassical model emphasizes aggregate supply by

focusing on the underlying determinants of output and employment in markets, and thus tends to put

more emphasis on economic growth and how labor markets work.

Chapter 14

1. As long as you remain within the walls of the casino, chips fit the definition of money; that is, they serve as

a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Chips do not work very well as money once

you leave the casino, but many kinds of money do not work well in other areas. For example, it is hard to

spend money from Turkey or Brazil at your local supermarket or at the movie theater.

2. Many physical items that a person buys at one time but may sell at another time can serve as an answer to

this question. Examples include a house, land, art, rare coins or stamps, and so on.

3. The currency and checks in M1 are easiest to spend. It is harder to spend M2 directly, although if there is

an automatic teller machine in the shopping mall, you can turn M2 from your savings account into an M1

of currency quite quickly. If your answer is about “credit cards,” then you are really talking about spending

M1—although it is M1 from the account of the credit card company, which you will repay later when you

credit card bill comes due.

4. a. Neither in M1 or M2

b. That is part of M1, and because M2 includes M1 it is also part of M2

c. Currency out in the public hands is part of M1 and M2

d. Checking deposits are in M1 and M2

590

e. Money market accounts are in M2

5. A bank’s assets include cash held in their vaults, but assets also include monies that the bank holds at the

Federal Reserve Bank (called “reserves”), loans that are made to customers, and bonds.

6. a. A borrower who has been late on a number of loan payments looks perhaps less likely to repay the

loan, or to repay it on time, and so you would want to pay less for that loan.

b.

If interest rates generally have risen, then this loan made at a time of relatively lower interest rates

looks less attractive, and you would pay less for it.

c.

If the borrower is a firm with a record of high profits, then it is likely to be able to repay the loan, and

you would be willing to pay more for the loan.

d.

If interest rates in the economy have fallen, then the loan is worth more.

Chapter 15

1. Longer terms insulate the Board from political forces. Since the presidency can potentially change every

four years, the Federal Reserve’s independence prevents drastic swings in monetary policy with every new

administration and allows policy decisions to be made only on economic grounds.

2. Banks make their money from issuing loans and charging interest. The more money that is stored in the

bank’s vault, the less is available for lending and the less money the bank stands to make.

3. The fear and uncertainty created by the suggestion that a bank might fail can lead depositors to withdraw

their money. If many depositors do this at the same time, the bank may not be able to meet their demands

and will, indeed, fail.

4. The bank has to hold $1,000 in reserves, so when it buys the $500 in bonds, it will have to reduce its loans

by $500 to make up the difference. The money supply decreases by the same amount.

5. An increase in reserve requirements would reduce the supply of money, since more money would be held

in banks rather than circulating in the economy.

6. Contractionary policy reduces the amount of loanable funds in the economy. As with all goods, greater

scarcity leads a greater price, so the interest rate, or the price of borrowing money, rises.

7. An increase in the amount of available loanable funds means that there are more people who want to lend.

They, therefore, bid the price of borrowing (the interest rate) down.

8. In times of economic uncertainty, banks may worry that borrowers will lose the ability to repay their loans.

They may also fear that a panic is more likely and they will need the excess reserves to meet their

obligations.

9. If consumer optimism changes, spending can speed up or slow down. This could also happen in a case

where consumers need to buy a large number of items quickly, such as in a situation of national

emergency.

Chapter 16

1. a. The British use the pound sterling, while Germans use the euro, so a British exporter will receive

euros from export sales, which will need to be exchanged for pounds. A stronger euro will mean more

pounds per euro, so the exporter will be better off. In addition, the lower price for German imports will

stimulate demand for British exports. For both these reasons, a stronger euro benefits the British

exporter.

b. The Dutch use euros while the Chileans use pesos, so the Dutch tourist needs to turn euros into

Chilean pesos. An increase in the euro means that the tourist will get more pesos per euro. As a

consequence, the Dutch tourist will have a less expensive vacation than he planned, so the tourist will

be better off.

c. The Greek use euros while the Canadians use dollars. An increase in the euro means it will buy more

Canadian dollars. As a result, the Greek bank will see a decrease in the cost of the Canadian bonds, so

Access for free at openstax.org

591

it may purchase more bonds. Either way, the Greek bank benefits.

d. Since both the French and Germans use the euro, an increase in the euro, in terms of other currencies,

should have no impact on the French exporter.

2. Expected depreciation in a currency will lead people to divest themselves of the currency. We should

expect to see an increase in the supply of pounds and a decrease in demand for pounds. The result should

be a decrease in the value of the pound vis à visthe dollar.

3. Lower U.S. interest rates make U.S. assets less desirable compared to assets in the European Union. We

should expect to see a decrease in demand for dollars and an increase in supply of dollars in foreign

currency markets. As a result, we should expect to see the dollar depreciate compared to the euro.

4. A decrease in Argentine inflation relative to other countries should cause an increase in demand for pesos,

a decrease in supply of pesos, and an appreciation of the peso in foreign currency markets.

5. The problem occurs when banks borrow foreign currency but lend in domestic currency. Since banks’

assets (loans they made) are in domestic currency, while their debts (money they borrowed) are in foreign

currency, when the domestic currency declines, their debts grow larger. If the domestic currency falls

substantially in value, as happened during the Asian financial crisis, then the banking system could fail.

This problem is unlikely to occur for U.S. banks because, even when they borrow from abroad, they tend to

borrow dollars. Remember, there are trillions of dollars in circulation in the global economy. Since both

assets and debts are in dollars, a change in the value of the dollar does not cause banking system failure

the way it can when banks borrow in foreign currency.

6. While capital flight is possible in either case, if a country borrows to invest in real capital it is more likely to

be able to generate the income to pay back its debts than a country that borrows to finance consumption.

As a result, an investment-stimulated economy is less likely to provoke capital flight and economic

recession.

7. A contractionary monetary policy, by driving up domestic interest rates, would cause the currency to

appreciate. The higher value of the currency in foreign exchange markets would reduce exports, since

from the perspective of foreign buyers, they are now more expensive. The higher value of the currency

would similarly stimulate imports, since they would now be cheaper from the perspective of domestic

buyers. Lower exports and higher imports cause net exports (EX – IM) to fall, which causes aggregate

demand to fall. The result would be a decrease in GDP working through the exchange rate mechanism

reinforcing the effect contractionary monetary policy has on domestic investment expenditure. However,

cheaper imports would stimulate aggregate supply, bringing GDP back to potential, though at a lower price

level.

8. For a currency to fall, a central bank need only supply more of its currency in foreign exchange markets. It

can print as much domestic currency as it likes. For a currency to rise, a central bank needs to buy its

currency in foreign exchange markets, paying with foreign currency. Since no central bank has an infinite

amount of foreign currency reserves, it cannot buy its currency indefinitely.

9. Variations in exchange rates, because they change import and export prices, disturb international trade

flows. When trade is a large part of a nation’s economic activity, government will find it more advantageous

to fix exchange rates to minimize disruptions of trade flows.

Chapter 17

1. The government borrows funds by selling Treasury bonds, notes, and bills.

2. The funds can be used to pay down the national debt or else be refunded to the taxpayers.

3. Yes, a nation can run budget deficits and see its debt/GDP ratio fall. In fact, this is not uncommon. If the
deficit is small in a given year, than the addition to debt in the numerator of the debt/GDP ratio will be

relatively small, while the growth in GDP is larger, and so the debt/GDP ratio declines. This was the

experience of the U.S. economy for the period from the end of World War II to about 1980. It is also

theoretically possible, although not likely, for a nation to have a budget surplus and see its debt/GDP ratio

rise. Imagine the case of a nation with a small surplus, but in a recession year when the economy shrinks.

592

It is possible that the decline in the nation’s debt, in the numerator of the debt/GDP ratio, would be

proportionally less than the fall in the size of GDP, so the debt/GDP ratio would rise.

4. Progressive. People who give larger gifts subject to the higher tax rate would typically have larger incomes

as well.

5. Corporate income tax on his profits, individual income tax on his salary, and payroll tax taken out of the

wages he pays himself.

6.

individual income taxes

7. The tax is regressive because wealthy income earners are not taxed at all on income above $113,000. As a

percent of total income, the social security tax hits lower income earners harder than wealthier

individuals.

8. As debt increases, interest payments also rise, so that the deficit grows even if we keep other government

spending constant.

9. a. As a share of GDP, this is false. In nominal dollars, it is true.

b. False.

c. False.

d. False. Education spending is much higher at the state level.

e. False. As a share of GDP, it is up about 50.

f. As a share of GDP, this is false, and in real dollars, it is also false.

g. False.

h. False; it’s about 1%.

i. False. Although budget deficits were large in 2003 and 2004, and continued into the later 2000s, the

federal government ran budget surpluses from 1998–2001.

j. False.

10. To keep prices from rising too much or too rapidly.

11. To increase employment.

12. It falls below because less tax revenue than expected is collected.

13. Automatic stabilizers take effect very quickly, whereas discretionary policy can take a long time to

implement.

14. In a recession, because of the decline in economic output, less income is earned, and so less in taxes is

automatically collected. Many welfare and unemployment programs are designed so that those who fall

into certain categories, like “unemployed” or “low income,” are eligible for benefits. During a recession,

more people fall into these categories and become eligible for benefits automatically. The combination of

reduced taxes and higher spending is just what is needed for an economy in recession producing below

potential GDP. With an economic boom, average income levels rise in the economy, so more in taxes is

automatically collected. Fewer people meet the criteria for receiving government assistance to the

unemployed or the needy, so government spending on unemployment assistance and welfare falls

automatically. This combination of higher taxes and lower spending is just what is needed if an economy

is producing above its potential GDP.

15. Prices would be pushed up as a result of too much spending.

16. Employment would suffer as a result of too little spending.

17. Monetary policy probably has shorter time lags than fiscal policy. Imagine that the data becomes fairly

clear that an economy is in or near a recession. Expansionary monetary policy can be carried out through

open market operations, which can be done fairly quickly, since the Federal Reserve’s Open Market

Committee meets six times a year. Also, monetary policy takes effect through interest rates, which can

change fairly quickly. However, fiscal policy is carried out through acts of Congress that need to be signed

into law by the president. Negotiating such laws often takes months, and even after the laws are

negotiated, it takes more months for spending programs or tax cuts to have an effect on the

macroeconomy.

18. The government would have to make up the revenue either by raising taxes in a different area or cutting

Access for free at openstax.org

593

spending.

19. Programs where the amount of spending is not fixed, but rather determined by macroeconomic

conditions, such as food stamps, would lose a great deal of flexibility if spending increases had to be met

by corresponding tax increases or spending cuts.

Chapter 18

1. We use the national savings and investment identity to solve this question. In this case, the government

has a budget surplus, so the government surplus appears as part of the supply of financial capital. Then:

2. a. Since the government has a budget surplus, the government budget term appears with the supply of

capital. The following shows the national savings and investment identity for this economy.

b. Plugging the given values into the identity shown in part (a), we find that (X – M) = 0.

c. Since the government has a budget deficit, the government budget term appears with the demand for

capital. You do not know in advance whether the economy has a trade deficit or a trade surplus. But

when you see that the quantity demanded of financial capital exceeds the quantity supplied, you know

that there must be an additional quantity of financial capital supplied by foreign investors, which

means a trade deficit of 2000. This example shows that in this case there is a higher budget deficit,

and a higher trade deficit.

3. In this case, the national saving and investment identity is written in this way:

The increase in the government budget surplus and the increase in the trade deficit both increased the

supply of financial capital. If investment in physical capital remained unchanged, then private savings

must go down, and if savings remained unchanged, then investment must go up. In fact, both effects

happened; that is, in the late 1990s, in the U.S. economy, savings declined and investment rose.

4. Ricardian equivalence means that private saving changes to offset exactly any changes in the government
budget. So, if the deficit increases by 20, private saving increases by 20 as well, and the trade deficit and

the budget deficit will not change from their original levels. The original national saving and investment

identity is written below. Notice that if any change in the (G – T) term is offset by a change in the S term,

then the other terms do not change. So if (G – T) rises by 20, then S must also increase by 20.

5. In the last few decades, spending per student has climbed substantially. However, test scores have fallen

over this time. This experience has led a number of experts to argue that the problem is not resources—or

is not just resources by itself—but is also a problem of how schools are organized and managed and what

incentives they have for success. There are a number of proposals to alter the incentives that schools face,

but relatively little hard evidence on what proposals work well. Without trying to evaluate whether these

proposals are good or bad ideas, you can just list some of them: testing students regularly; rewarding

teachers or schools that perform well on such tests; requiring additional teacher training; allowing

594

students to choose between public schools; allowing teachers and parents to start new schools; giving

student “vouchers” that they can use to pay tuition at either public or private schools.

6. The government can direct government spending to R&D. It can also create tax incentives for business to

invest in R&D.

East Asia appears to be the largest economy on GDP basis, but on a per capita basis it drops to third, after

Europe and Central Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.

2. A region can have some of high-income countries and some of the low-income countries. Aggregating per

capita real GDP will vary widely across countries within a region, so aggregating data for a region has little

meaning. For example, if you were to compare per capital real GDP for the United States, Canada, Haiti,

and Honduras, it looks much different than if you looked at the same data for North America as a whole.

Thus, regional comparisons are broad-based and may not adequately capture an individual country’s

economic attributes.

4. Low-income countries must adopt government policies that are market-oriented and that educate the

workforce and population. After this is done, low-income countries should focus on eradicating other

social ills that inhibit their growth. The economically challenged are stuck in poverty traps. They need to

focus more on health and education and create a stable macroeconomic and political environment. This

will attract foreign aid and foreign investment. Middle-income countries strive for increases in physical

capital and innovation, while higher-income countries must work to maintain their economies through

innovation and technology.

5. If there is a recession and unemployment increases, we can call on an expansionary fiscal policy (lower

taxes or increased government spending) or an expansionary monetary policy (increase the money supply

and lower interest rates). Both policies stimulate output and decrease unemployment.

6. Aside from a high natural rate of unemployment due to government regulations, subsistence households

may be counted as not working.

7. Indexing wage contracts means wages rise when prices rise. This means what you can buy with your

wages, your standard of living, remains the same. When wages are not indexed, or rise with inflation, your

standard of living falls.

8. An increase in government spending shifts the AD curve to the right, raising both income and price levels.

9. A decrease in the money supply will shift the AD curve leftward and reduce income and price levels. Banks

will have less money to lend. Interest rates will increase, affecting consumption and investment, which are

both key determinants of aggregate demand.

10. Given the high level of activity in international financial markets, it is typically believed that financial

flows across borders are the real reason for trade imbalances. For example, the United States had an

enormous trade deficit in the late 1990s and early 2000s because it was attracting vast inflows of foreign

capital. Smaller countries that have attracted such inflows of international capital worry that if the inflows

suddenly turn to outflows, the resulting decline in their currency could collapse their banking system and

bring on a deep recession.

596

11. The demand for the country’s currency would decrease, lowering the exchange rate.

Chapter 20

1. False. Anything that leads to different levels of productivity between two economies can be a source of

comparative advantage. For example, the education of workers, the knowledge base of engineers and

scientists in a country, the part of a split-up value chain where they have their specialized learning,

economies of scale, and other factors can all determine comparative advantage.

2. Brazil has the absolute advantage in producing beef and the United States has the absolute advantage in

autos. The opportunity cost of producing one pound of beef is 1/10 of an auto; in the United States it is 3/4

of an auto.

3. In answering questions like these, it is often helpful to begin by organizing the information in a table, such

as in the following table. Notice that, in this case, the productivity of the countries is expressed in terms of

how many workers it takes to produce a unit of a product.

Country One Sweater One Bottle of wine

France

1 worker

1 worker

Tunisia

2 workers

3 workers

In this example, France has an absolute advantage in the production of both sweaters and wine. You can

tell because it takes France less labor to produce a unit of the good.

4. a.

In Germany, it takes fewer workers to make either a television or a video camera. Germany has an

absolute advantage in the production of both goods.

b. Producing an additional television in Germany requires three workers. Shifting those three German

workers will reduce video camera production by 3/4 of a camera. Producing an additional television

set in Poland requires six workers, and shifting those workers from the other good reduces output of

video cameras by 6/12 of a camera, or 1/2. Thus, the opportunity cost of producing televisions is lower

in Poland, so Poland has the comparative advantage in the production of televisions. Note: Do not let

the fractions like 3/4 of a camera or 1/2 of a video camera bother you. If either country was to expand

television production by a significant amount—that is, lots more than one unit—then we will be talking

about whole cameras and not fractional ones. You can also spot this conclusion by noticing that

Poland’s absolute disadvantage is relatively lower in televisions, because Poland needs twice as many

workers to produce a television but three times as many to produce a video camera, so the product

with the relatively lower absolute disadvantage is Poland’s comparative advantage.

c. Producing a video camera in Germany requires four workers, and shifting those four workers away

from television production has an opportunity cost of 4/3 television sets. Producing a video camera in

Poland requires 12 workers, and shifting those 12 workers away from television production has an

opportunity cost of two television sets. Thus, the opportunity cost of producing video cameras is lower

in Germany, and video cameras will be Germany’s comparative advantage.

d.

In this example, absolute advantage differs from comparative advantage. Germany has the absolute

advantage in the production of both goods, but Poland has a comparative advantage in the production

of televisions.

e. Germany should specialize, at least to some extent, in the production of video cameras, export video

cameras, and import televisions. Conversely, Poland should specialize, at least to some extent, in the

production of televisions, export televisions, and import video cameras.

5. There are a number of possible advantages of intra-industry trade. Both nations can take advantage of

extreme specialization and learning in certain kinds of cars with certain traits, like gas-efficient cars,

luxury cars, sport-utility vehicles, higher- and lower-quality cars, and so on. Moreover, nations can take

Access for free at openstax.org

597

advantage of economies of scale, so that large companies will compete against each other across

international borders, providing the benefits of competition and variety to customers. This same argument

applies to trade between U.S. states, where people often buy products made by people of other states, even

though a similar product is made within the boundaries of their own state. All states—and all

countries—can benefit from this kind of competition and trade.

6. a. Start by plotting the points on a sketch diagram and then drawing a line through them. The following

figure illustrates the average costs of production of semiconductors.

The curve illustrates economies of scale by showing that as the scale increases—that is, as production

at this particular factory goes up—the average cost of production declines. The economies of scale

exist up to an output of 40,000 semiconductors; at higher outputs, the average cost of production does

not seem to decline any further.

b. At any quantity demanded above 40,000, this economy can take full advantage of economies of scale;

that is, it can produce at the lowest cost per unit. Indeed, if the quantity demanded was quite high, like

500,000, then there could be a number of different factories all taking full advantage of economies of

scale and competing with each other. If the quantity demanded falls below 40,000, then the economy

by itself, without foreign trade, cannot take full advantage of economies of scale.

c. The simplest answer to this question is that the small country could have a large enough factory to

take full advantage of economies of scale, but then export most of the output. For semiconductors,

countries like Taiwan and Korea have recently fit this description. Moreover, this country could also

import semiconductors from other countries which also have large factories, thus getting the benefits

of competition and variety. A slightly more complex answer is that the country can get these benefits

of economies of scale without producing semiconductors, but simply by buying semiconductors made

at low cost around the world. An economy, especially a smaller country, may well end up specializing

and producing a few items on a large scale, but then trading those items for other items produced on a

large scale, and thus gaining the benefits of economies of scale by trade, as well as by direct

production.

7. A nation might restrict trade on imported products to protect an industry that is important for national

security. For example, nation X and nation Y may be geopolitical rivals, each with ambitions of increased

political and economic strength. Even if nation Y has comparative advantage in the production of missile

defense systems, it is unlikely that nation Y would seek to export those goods to nation X. It is also the case

that, for some nations, the production of a particular good is a key component of national identity. In

Japan, the production of rice is culturally very important. It may be difficult for Japan to import rice from a

nation like Vietnam, even if Vietnam has a comparative advantage in rice production.

598

Chapter 21

1. This is the opposite case of the Work It Out feature. A reduced tariff is like a decrease in the cost of

production, which is shown by a downward (or rightward) shift in the supply curve.

2. A subsidy is like a reduction in cost. This shifts the supply curve down (or to the right), driving the price of

sugar down. If the subsidy is large enough, the price of sugar can fall below the cost of production faced by

foreign producers, which means they will lose money on any sugar they produce and sell.

3. Trade barriers raise the price of goods in protected industries. If those products are inputs in other

industries, it raises their production costs and then prices, so sales fall in those other industries. Lower

sales lead to lower employment. Additionally, if the protected industries are consumer goods, their

customers pay higher prices, which reduce demand for other consumer products and thus employment in

those industries.

4. Trade based on comparative advantage raises the average wage rate economy-wide, though it can reduce

the incomes of import-substituting industries. By moving away from a country’s comparative advantage,

trade barriers do the opposite: they give workers in protected industries an advantage, while reducing the

average wage economy-wide.

5. By raising incomes, trade tends to raise working conditions also, even though those conditions may not

(yet) be equivalent to those in high-income countries.

6. They typically pay more than the next-best alternative. If a Nike firm did not pay workers at least as much

as they would earn, for example, in a subsistence rural lifestyle, they many never come to work for Nike.

7. Since trade barriers raise prices, real incomes fall. The average worker would also earn less.

8. Workers working in other sectors and the protected sector see a decrease in their real wage.

9. If imports can be sold at extremely low prices, domestic firms would have to match those prices to be

competitive. By definition, matching prices would imply selling under cost and, therefore, losing money.

Firms cannot sustain losses forever. When they leave the industry, importers can “take over,” raising

prices to monopoly levels to cover their short-term losses and earn long-term profits.

10. Because low-income countries need to provide necessities—food, clothing, and shelter—to their people. In

other words, they consider environmental quality a luxury.

11. Low-income countries can compete for jobs by reducing their environmental standards to attract

business to their countries. This could lead to a competitive reduction in regulations, which would lead to

greater environmental damage. While pollution management is a cost for businesses, it is tiny relative to

other costs, like labor and adequate infrastructure. It is also costly for firms to locate far away from their

customers, which many low-income countries are.

12. The decision should not be arbitrary or unnecessarily discriminatory. It should treat foreign companies

the same way as domestic companies. It should be based on science.

13. Restricting imports today does not solve the problem. If anything, it makes it worse since it implies using

up domestic sources of the products faster than if they are imported. Also, the national security argument

can be used to support protection of nearly any product, not just things critical to our national security.

14. The effect of increasing standards may increase costs to the small exporting country. The supply curve of

toys will shift to the left. Exports will decrease and toy prices will rise. Tariffs also raise prices. So the effect

on the price of toys is the same. A tariff is a “second best” policy and also affects other sectors. However, a

common standard across countries is a “first best” policy that attacks the problem at its root.

15. A free trade association offers free trade between its members, but each country can determine its own

trade policy outside the association. A common market requires a common external trade policy in

addition to free trade within the group. An economic union is a common market with coordinated fiscal

and monetary policy.

16. International agreements can serve as a political counterweight to domestic special interests, thereby

preventing stronger protectionist measures.

17. Reductions in tariffs, quotas, and other trade barriers, improved transportation, and communication
